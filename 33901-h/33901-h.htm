<h2>Chapter One.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />THE LOVE-LIGHT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Long ago, in the days when our caged blackbirds
never saw a king&#8217;s soldier without whistling impudently,
&#8220;Come ower the water to Charlie,&#8221; a minister of Thrums
was to be married, but something happened, and he remained
a bachelor. Then, when he was old, he passed
in our square the lady who was to have been his wife,
and her hair was white, but she, too, was still unmarried.
The meeting had only one witness, a weaver, and
he said solemnly afterwards, &#8220;They didna speak, but
they just gave one another a look, and I saw the love-light
in their een.&#8221; No more is remembered of these
two, no being now living ever saw them, but the poetry
that was in the soul of a battered weaver makes them
human to us for ever.</p>
<p>It is of another minister I am to tell, but only to those
who know that light when they see it. I am not bidding
good-bye to many readers, for though it is true
that some men, of whom Lord Rintoul was one, live to
an old age without knowing love, few of us can have
met them, and of women so incomplete I never heard.</p>
<p>Gavin Dishart was barely twenty-one when he and
his mother came to Thrums, light-hearted like the traveller
who knows not what awaits him at the bend of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
road. It was the time of year when the ground is carpeted
beneath the firs with brown needles, when split-nuts
patter all day from the beech, and children lay
yellow corn on the dominie&#8217;s desk to remind him that
now they are needed in the fields. The day was so
silent that carts could be heard rumbling a mile away.
All Thrums was out in its wynds and closes&mdash;a few of
the weavers still in knee-breeches&mdash;to look at the new
Auld Licht minister. I was there too, the dominie of
Glen Quharity, which is four miles from Thrums; and
heavy was my heart as I stood afar off so that Gavin&#8217;s
mother might not have the pain of seeing me. I was
the only one in the crowd who looked at her more than
at her son.</p>
<p>Eighteen years had passed since we parted. Already
her hair had lost the brightness of its youth, and she
seemed to me smaller and more fragile; and the face
that I loved when I was a hobbledehoy, and loved when
I looked once more upon it in Thrums, and always shall
love till I die, was soft and worn. Margaret was an old
woman, and she was only forty-three; and I am the man
who made her old. As Gavin put his eager boyish face
out at the carriage window, many saw that he was holding
her hand, but none could be glad at the sight as the
dominie was glad, looking on at a happiness in which
he dared not mingle. Margaret was crying because
she was so proud of her boy. Women do that. Poor
sons to be proud of, good mothers, but I would not have
you dry those tears.</p>

</div>
<p>When the little minister looked out at the carriage
window, many of the people drew back humbly, but a
little boy in a red frock with black spots pressed forward
and offered him a sticky parly, which Gavin accepted,
though not without a tremor, for children were more
terrible to him then than bearded men. The boy&#8217;s
mother, trying not to look elated, bore him away, but
her face said that he was made for life. With this little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
incident Gavin&#8217;s career in Thrums began. I remembered
it suddenly the other day when wading across the
wynd where it took place. Many scenes in the little
minister&#8217;s life come back to me in this way. The first
time I ever thought of writing his love story as an old
man&#8217;s gift to a little maid since grown tall, was one
night while I sat alone in the school-house; on my
knees a fiddle that has been my only living companion
since I sold my hens. My mind had drifted back to the
first time I saw Gavin and the Egyptian together, and
what set it wandering to that midnight meeting was
my garden gate shaking in the wind. At a gate on the
hill I had first encountered these two. It rattled in his
hand, and I looked up and saw them, and neither knew
why I had such cause to start at the sight. Then the
gate swung to. It had just such a click as mine.</p>
<p>These two figures on the hill are more real to me than
things that happened yesterday, but I do not know that
I can make them live to others. A ghost-show used to
come yearly to Thrums on the merry Muckle Friday,
in which the illusion was contrived by hanging a glass
between the onlookers and the stage. I cannot deny
that the comings and goings of the ghost were highly
diverting, yet the farmer of T&#8217;nowhead only laughed
because he had paid his money at the hole in the door
like the rest of us. T&#8217;nowhead sat at the end of a form
where he saw round the glass and so saw no ghost. I
fear my public may be in the same predicament. I see
the little minister as he was at one-and-twenty, and the
little girl to whom this story is to belong sees him,
though the things I have to tell happened before she
came into the world. But there are reasons why she
should see; and I do not know that I can provide the
glass for others. If they see round it, they will neither
laugh nor cry with Gavin and Babbie.</p>
<p>When Gavin came to Thrums he was as I am now,
for the pages lay before him on which he was to write
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
his life. Yet he was not quite as I am. The life of
every man is a diary in which he means to write one
story, and writes another; and his humblest hour is
when he compares the volume as it is with what he
vowed to make it. But the biographer sees the last
chapter while he is still at the first, and I have only to
write over with ink what Gavin has written in pencil.</p>
<p>How often is it a <ins title='Was phanton'>phantom</ins> woman who draws the man
from the way he meant to go? So was man created, to
hunger for the ideal that is above himself, until one day
there is magic in the air, and the eyes of a girl rest upon
him. He does not know that it is he himself who
crowned her, and if the girl is as pure as he, their love
is the one form of idolatry that is not quite ignoble. It
is the joining of two souls on their way to God. But if
the woman be bad, the test of the man is when he
wakens from his dream. The nobler his ideal, the
further will he have been hurried down the wrong way,
for those who only run after little things will not go
far. His love may now sink into passion, perhaps only
to stain its wings and rise again, perhaps to drown.</p>
<p>Babbie, what shall I say of you who make me write
these things? I am not your judge. Shall we not
laugh at the student who chafes when between him and
his book comes the song of the thrushes, with whom, on
the mad night you danced into Gavin&#8217;s life, you had
more in common than with Auld Licht ministers? The
gladness of living was in your step, your voice was
melody, and he was wondering what love might be.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>You were the daughter of a summer night, born
where all the birds are free, and the moon christened
you with her soft light to dazzle the eyes of man. Not
our little minister alone was stricken by you into his
second childhood. To look upon you was to rejoice that
so fair a thing could be; to think of you is still to be
young. Even those who called you a little devil, of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
whom I have been one, admitted that in the end you
had a soul, though not that you had been born with one.
They said you stole it, and so made a woman of yourself.
But again I say I am not your judge, and when
I picture you as Gavin saw you first, a bare-legged
witch dancing up Windyghoul, rowan berries in your
black hair, and on your finger a jewel the little minister
could not have bought with five years of toil, the shadows
on my pages lift, and I cannot wonder that Gavin
loved you.</p>
<p>Often I say to myself that this is to be Gavin&#8217;s story,
not mine. Yet must it be mine too, in a manner, and
of myself I shall sometimes have to speak; not willingly,
for it is time my little tragedy had died of old
age. I have kept it to myself so long that now I would
stand at its grave alone. It is true that when I heard
who was to be the new minister I hoped for a day that
the life broken in Harvie might be mended in Thrums,
but two minutes&#8217; talk with Gavin showed me that Margaret
had kept from him the secret which was hers and
mine, and so knocked the bottom out of my vain hopes.
I did not blame her then, nor do I blame her now, nor
shall any one who blames her ever be called friend by
me; but it was bitter to look at the white manse among
the trees and know that I must never enter it. For
Margaret&#8217;s sake I had to keep aloof, yet this new trial
came upon me like our parting at Harvie. I thought
that in those eighteen years my passions had burned
like a ship till they sank, but I suffered again as on that
awful night when Adam Dishart came back, nearly
killing Margaret and tearing up all my ambitions by
the root in a single hour. I waited in Thrums until I
had looked again on Margaret, who thought me dead,
and Gavin, who had never heard of me, and then I
trudged back to the school-house. Something I heard
of them from time to time during the winter&mdash;for in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
gossip of Thrums I was well posted&mdash;but much of what
is to be told here I only learned afterwards from those
who knew it best. Gavin heard of me at times as the
dominie in the glen who had ceased to attend the Auld
Licht kirk, and Margaret did not even hear of me. It
was all I could do for them.</p>

<h2>Chapter Two.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />RUNS ALONGSIDE THE MAKING OF A MINISTER.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>On the east coast of Scotland, hidden, as if in a
quarry, at the foot of cliffs that may one day fall forward,
is a village called Harvie. So has it shrunk since
the day when I skulked from it that I hear of a traveller&#8217;s
asking lately at one of its doors how far he was
from a village; yet Harvie throve once and was celebrated
even in distant Thrums for its fish. Most of our
weavers would have thought it as unnatural not to buy
harvies in the square on the Muckle Friday, as to let
Saturday night pass without laying in a sufficient stock
of halfpennies to go round the family twice.</p>
<p>Gavin was born in Harvie, but left it at such an early
age that he could only recall thatched houses with nets
drying on the roofs, and a sandy shore in which coarse
grass grew. In the picture he could not pick out the
house of his birth, though he might have been able to
go to it had he ever returned to the village. Soon he
learned that his mother did not care to speak of Harvie,
and perhaps he thought that she had forgotten it too,
all save one scene to which his memory still guided
him. When his mind wandered to Harvie, Gavin saw
the door of his home open and a fisherman enter, who
scratched his head and then said, &#8220;Your man&#8217;s drowned,
missis.&#8221; Gavin seemed to see many women crying,
and his mother staring at them with a face suddenly
painted white, and next to hear a voice that was his
own saying, &#8220;Never mind, mother; I&#8217;ll be a man to
you now, and I&#8217;ll need breeks for the burial.&#8221; But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
Adam required no funeral, for his body lay deep in the
sea.</p>
<p>Gavin thought that this was the tragedy of his
mother&#8217;s life, and the most memorable event of his own
childhood. But it was neither. When Margaret, even
after she came to Thrums, thought of Harvie, it was
not at Adam&#8217;s death she shuddered, but at the recollection
of me.</p>
<p>It would ill become me to take a late revenge on
Adam Dishart now by saying what is not true of him.
Though he died a fisherman he was a sailor for a great
part of his life, and doubtless his recklessness was
washed into him on the high seas, where in his time
men made a crony of death, and drank merrily over
dodging it for another night. To me his roars of laughter
without cause were as repellent as a boy&#8217;s drum;
yet many faces that were long in my company brightened
at his coming, and women, with whom, despite my
yearning, I was in no wise a favorite, ran to their doors
to listen to him as readily as to the bell-man. Children
scurried from him if his mood was savage, but to him
at all other times, while me they merely disregarded.
There was always a smell of the sea about him. He
had a rolling gait, unless he was drunk, when he walked
very straight, and before both sexes he boasted that
any woman would take him for his beard alone. Of
this beard he took prodigious care, though otherwise
thinking little of his appearance, and I now see that he
understood women better than I did, who had nevertheless
reflected much about them. It cannot be said that
he was vain, for though he thought he attracted women
strangely, that, I maintain, is a weakness common to
all men, and so no more to be marvelled at than a stake
in a fence. Foreign oaths were the nails with which
he held his talk together, yet I doubt not they were a
curiosity gathered at sea, like his chains of shells, more
for his own pleasure than for others&#8217; pain. His friends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
gave them no weight, and when he wanted to talk emphatically
he kept them back, though they were then
as troublesome to him as eggs to the bird-nesting boy
who has to speak with his spoil in his mouth.</p>
<p>Adam was drowned on Gavin&#8217;s fourth birthday, a
year after I had to leave Harvie. He was blown off
his smack in a storm, and could not reach the rope his
partner flung him. &#8220;It&#8217;s no go, lad,&#8221; he shouted; &#8220;so
long, Jim,&#8221; and sank.</p>
<p>A month afterwards Margaret sold her share in the
smack, which was all Adam left her, and the furniture
of the house was rouped. She took Gavin to Glasgow,
where her only brother needed a housekeeper, and there
mother and son remained until Gavin got his call to
Thrums. During those seventeen years I lost knowledge
of them as completely as Margaret had lost knowledge
of me. On hearing of Adam&#8217;s death I went back
to Harvie to try to trace her, but she had feared this,
and so told no one where she was going.</p>
<p>According to Margaret, Gavin&#8217;s genius showed itself
while he was still a child. He was born with a brow
whose nobility impressed her from the first. It was a
minister&#8217;s brow, and though Margaret herself was no
scholar, being as slow to read as she was quick at turning
bannocks on the girdle, she decided, when his age
was still counted by months, that the ministry had need
of him. In those days the first question asked of a child
was not, &#8220;Tell me your name,&#8221; but &#8220;What are you to
be?&#8221; and one child in every family replied, &#8220;A minister.&#8221;
He was set apart for the Church as doggedly as
the shilling a week for the rent, and the rule held good
though the family consisted of only one boy. From his
earliest days Gavin thought he had been fashioned for
the ministry as certainly as a spade for digging, and Margaret
rejoiced and marvelled thereat, though she had
made her own puzzle. An enthusiastic mother may
bend her son&#8217;s mind as she chooses if she begins at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
once; nay, she may do stranger things. I know a
mother in Thrums who loves &#8220;features,&#8221; and had a
child born with no chin to speak of. The neighbors
expected this to bring her to the dust, but it only
showed what a mother can do. In a few months that
child had a chin with the best of them.</p>
<p>Margaret&#8217;s brother died, but she remained in his
single room, and, ever with a picture of her son in a
pulpit to repay her, contrived to keep Gavin at school.
Everything a woman&#8217;s fingers can do Margaret&#8217;s did
better than most, and among the wealthy people who
employed her&mdash;would that I could have the teaching of
the sons of such as were good to her in those hard days!&mdash;her
gentle manner was spoken of. For though Margaret
had no schooling, she was a lady at heart, moving
and almost speaking as one even in Harvie, where they
did not perhaps like her the better for it.</p>
<p>At six Gavin hit another boy hard for belonging to
the Established Church, and at seven he could not lose
himself in the Shorter Catechism. His mother expounded
the Scriptures to him till he was eight, when
he began to expound them to her. By this time he was
studying the practical work of the pulpit as enthusiastically
as ever medical student cut off a leg. From a
front pew in the gallery Gavin watched the minister&#8217;s
every movement, noting that the first thing to do on
ascending the pulpit is to cover your face with your
hands, as if the exalted position affected you like a
strong light, and the second to move the big Bible
slightly, to show that the kirk officer, not having had a
university education, could not be expected to know the
very spot on which it ought to lie. Gavin saw that the
minister joined in the singing more like one countenancing
a seemly thing than because he needed it himself,
and that he only sang a mouthful now and again
after the congregation was in full pursuit of the precentor.
It was noteworthy that the first prayer lasted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
longer than all the others, and that to read the intimations
about the Bible-class and the collection elsewhere
than immediately before the last Psalm would have
been as sacrilegious as to insert the dedication to King
James at the end of Revelation. Sitting under a minister
justly honoured in his day, the boy was often some
words in advance of him, not vainglorious of his memory,
but fervent, eager, and regarding the preacher as
hardly less sacred than the Book. Gavin was encouraged
by his frightened yet admiring mother to saw the
air from their pew as the minister sawed it in the pulpit,
and two benedictions were pronounced twice a Sabbath
in that church, in the same words, the same manner, and
simultaneously.</p>
<p>There was a black year when the things of this
world, especially its pastimes, took such a grip of Gavin
that he said to Margaret he would rather be good at the
high jump than the author of &#8220;The Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress.&#8221;
That year passed, and Gavin came to his right mind.
One afternoon Margaret was at home making a glengarry
for him out of a piece of carpet, and giving it a
tartan edging, when the boy bounded in from school,
crying, &#8220;Come quick, mother, and you&#8217;ll see him.&#8221;
Margaret reached the door in time to see a street musician
flying from Gavin and his friends. &#8220;Did you take
stock of him, mother?&#8221; the boy asked when he reappeared
with the mark of a muddy stick on his back.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a Papist!&mdash;a sore sight, mother, a sore sight.
We stoned him for persecuting the noble Martyrs.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Gavin was twelve he went to the university,
and also got a place in a shop as errand boy. He used
to run through the streets between his work and his
classes. Potatoes and salt fish, which could then be got
at two pence the pound if bought by the half-hundred
weight, were his food. There was not always a good
meal for two, yet when Gavin reached home at night
there was generally something ready for him, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
Margaret had supped &#8220;hours ago.&#8221; Gavin&#8217;s hunger
urged him to fall to, but his love for his mother made
him watchful.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you have yourself, mother?&#8221; he would demand
suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I had a fine supper, I assure you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What had you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had potatoes, for one thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And dripping?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, you&#8217;re cheating me. The dripping hasn&#8217;t
been touched since yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna&mdash;don&#8217;t&mdash;care for dripping&mdash;no much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then would Gavin stride the room fiercely, a queer
little figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I&#8217;ll stand this, mother? Will I let
myself be pampered with dripping and every delicacy
while you starve?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gavin, I really dinna care for dripping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll give up my classes, and we can have
butter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I assure you I&#8217;m no hungry. It&#8217;s different wi&#8217; a
growing laddie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a growing laddie,&#8221; Gavin would say, bitterly;
&#8220;but, mother, I warn you that not another bite
passes my throat till I see you eating too.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Margaret had to take her seat at the table, and
when she said &#8220;I can eat no more,&#8221; Gavin retorted
sternly, &#8220;Nor will I, for fine I see through you.&#8221;</p>
<p>These two were as one far more than most married
people, and, just as Gavin in his childhood reflected
his mother, she now reflected him. The people for
whom she sewed thought it was contact with them that
had rubbed the broad Scotch from her tongue, but she
was only keeping pace with Gavin. When she was excited
the Harvie words came back to her, as they come
back to me. I have taught the English language all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
my life, and I try to write it, but everything I say in
this book I first think to myself in the Doric. This,
too, I notice, that in talking to myself I am broader
than when gossiping with the farmers of the glen, who
send their children to me to learn English, and then
jeer at them if they say &#8220;old lights&#8221; instead of &#8220;auld
lichts.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Margaret it was happiness to sit through the long
evenings sewing, and look over her work at Gavin as
he read or wrote or recited to himself the learning of
the schools. But she coughed every time the weather
changed, and then Gavin would start.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must go to your bed, mother,&#8221; he would say,
tearing himself from his books; or he would sit beside
her and talk of the dream that was common to both&mdash;a
dream of a manse where Margaret was mistress and
Gavin was called the minister. Every night Gavin was
at his mother&#8217;s bedside to wind her shawl round her
feet, and while he did it Margaret smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, this is the chaff pillow you&#8217;ve taken out of
my bed, and given me your feather one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gavin, you needna change them. I winna have the
feather pillow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you dare to think I&#8217;ll let you sleep on chaff?
Put up your head. Now, is that soft?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine. I dinna deny but what I sleep better on
feathers. Do you mind, Gavin, you bought this pillow
for me the moment you got your bursary money?&#8221;</p>
<p>The reserve that is a wall between many of the Scottish
poor had been broken down by these two. When
he saw his mother sleeping happily, Gavin went back to
his work. To save the expense of a lamp, he would
put his book almost beneath the dying fire, and, taking
the place of the fender, read till he was shivering with
cold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gavin, it is near morning, and you not in your bed
yet! What are you thinking about so hard?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mother, I was wondering if the time would ever
come when I would be a minister, and you would have
an egg for your breakfast every morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the years passed, and soon Gavin would be a minister.
He had now sermons to prepare, and every one
of them was first preached to Margaret. How solemn
was his voice, how his eyes flashed, how stern were his
admonitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gavin, such a sermon I never heard. The spirit of
God is on you. I&#8217;m ashamed you should have me for a
mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God grant, mother,&#8221; Gavin said, little thinking what
was soon to happen, or he would have made this prayer
on his knees, &#8220;that you may never be ashamed to have
me for a son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, mother,&#8221; he would say wistfully, &#8220;it is not a
great sermon, but do you think I&#8217;m preaching Christ?
That is what I try, but I&#8217;m carried away and forget to
watch myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord has you by the hand, Gavin; and mind, I
dinna say that because you&#8217;re my laddie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you do, mother, and well I know it, and yet it
does me good to hear you.&#8221;</p>
<p>That it did him good I, who would fain have shared
those days with them, am very sure. The praise that
comes of love does not make us vain, but humble rather.
Knowing what we are, the pride that shines in our
mother&#8217;s eyes as she looks at us is about the most pathetic
thing a man has to face, but he would be a devil
altogether if it did not burn some of the sin out of
him.</p>
<p>Not long before Gavin preached for our kirk and got
his call, a great event took place in the little room at
Glasgow. The student appeared for the first time before
his mother in his ministerial clothes. He wore the
black silk hat, that was destined to become a terror to
evil-doers in Thrums, and I dare say he was rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
puffed up about himself that day. You would probably
have smiled at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity I&#8217;m so little, mother,&#8221; he said with a sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re no what I would call a particularly long
man,&#8221; Margaret said, &#8220;but you&#8217;re just the height I
like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Gavin went out in his grandeur, and Margaret
cried for an hour. She was thinking of me as well as
of Gavin, and as it happens, I know that I was thinking
at the same time of her. Gavin kept a diary in those
days, which I have seen, and by comparing it with
mine, I discovered that while he was showing himself
to his mother in his black clothes, I was on my way
back from Tilliedrum, where I had gone to buy a sand-glass
for the school. The one I bought was so like another
Margaret had used at Harvie that it set me
thinking of her again all the way home. This is a
matter hardly worth mentioning, and yet it interests
me.</p>
<p>Busy days followed the call to Thrums, and Gavin
had difficulty in forcing himself to his sermons when
there was always something more to tell his mother
about the weaving town they were going to, or about
the manse or the furniture that had been transferred to
him by the retiring minister. The little room which
had become so familiar that it seemed one of a family
party of three had to be stripped, and many of its contents
were sold. Among what were brought to Thrums
was a little exercise book, in which Margaret had tried,
unknown to Gavin, to teach herself writing and grammar,
that she might be less unfit for a manse. He
found it accidentally one day. It was full of &#8220;I am,
thou art, he is,&#8221; and the like, written many times in a
shaking hand. Gavin put his arms round his mother
when he saw what she had been doing. The exercise
book is in my desk now, and will be my little maid&#8217;s
when I die.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Gavin, Gavin,&#8221; Margaret said many times in those
last days at Glasgow, &#8220;to think it has all come true!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the last word you say in the house be a prayer
of thankfulness,&#8221; she whispered to him when they were
taking a final glance at the old home.</p>
<p>In the bare room they called the house, the little
minister and his mother went on their knees, but, as it
chanced, their last word there was not addressed to God.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gavin,&#8221; Margaret whispered as he took her arm,
&#8220;do you think this bonnet sets me?&#8221;</p>

<p>What first struck Margaret in Thrums was the smell
of the caddis. The town smells of caddis no longer, but
whiffs of it may be got even now as one passes the
houses of the old, where the lay still swings at little
windows like a great ghost pendulum. To me it is a
homely smell, which I draw in with a great breath, but
it was as strange to Margaret as the weavers themselves,
who, in their colored nightcaps and corduroys streaked
with threads, gazed at her and Gavin. The little minister
was trying to look severe and old, but twenty-one
was in his eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, mother, at that white house with the green
roof. That is the manse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The manse stands high, with a sharp eye on all the
town. Every back window in the Tenements has a
glint of it, and so the back of the Tenements is always
better behaved than the front. It was in the front that
Jamie Don, a pitiful bachelor all his life because he
thought the women proposed, kept his ferrets, and here,
too, Beattie hanged himself, going straight to the
clothes-posts for another rope when the first one broke,
such was his determination. In the front Sanders Gilruth
openly boasted (on Don&#8217;s potato-pit) that by having
a seat in two churches he could lie in bed on Sabbath
and get the credit of being at one or other. (Gavin
made short work of him.) To the right-minded the
Auld Licht manse was as a family Bible, ever lying
open before them, but Beattie spoke for more than himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
when he said, &#8220;Dagone that manse! I never gie a
swear but there it is glowering at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The manse looks down on the town from the north-east,
and is reached from the road that leaves Thrums
behind it in another moment by a wide, straight path,
so rough that to carry a fraught of water to the manse
without spilling was to be superlatively good at one
thing. Packages in a cart it set leaping like trout in a
fishing-creel. Opposite the opening of the garden wall
in the manse, where for many years there had been an
intention of putting up a gate, were two big stones a
yard apart, standing ready for the winter, when the
path was often a rush of yellow water, and this the only
bridge to the glebe dyke, down which the minister
walked to church.</p>
<p>When Margaret entered the manse on Gavin&#8217;s arm, it
was a whitewashed house of five rooms, with a garret
in which the minister could sleep if he had guests, as
during the Fast week. It stood with its garden within
high walls, and the roof facing southward was carpeted
with moss that shone in the sun in a dozen shades of
green and yellow. Three firs guarded the house from
west winds, but blasts from the north often tore
down the steep fields and skirled through the manse,
banging all its doors at once. A beech, growing on
the east side, leant over the roof as if to gossip with
the well in the courtyard. The garden was to the
south, and was over full of gooseberry and currant
bushes. It contained a summer seat, where strange
things were soon to happen.</p>
<p>Margaret would not even take off her bonnet until she
had seen through the manse and opened all the presses.
The parlour and kitchen were downstairs, and of the
three rooms above, the study was so small that Gavin&#8217;s
predecessor could touch each of its walls without shifting
his position. Every room save Margaret&#8217;s had long-lidded
beds, which close as if with shutters, but hers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
was coff-fronted, or comparatively open, with carving
on the wood like the ornamentation of coffins. Where
there were children in a house they liked to slope the
boards of the closed-in bed against the dresser, and play
at sliding down mountains on them.</p>
<p>But for many years there had been no children in the
manse. He in whose ways Gavin was to attempt the
heavy task of walking had been a widower three months
after his marriage, a man narrow when he came to
Thrums, but so large-hearted when he left it that I,
who know there is good in all the world because of the
lovable souls I have met in this corner of it, yet cannot
hope that many are as near to God as he. The most
gladsome thing in the world is that few of us fall very
low; the saddest that, with such capabilities, we seldom
rise high. Of those who stand perceptibly above their
fellows I have known very few; only Mr. Carfrae and
two or three women.</p>
<p>Gavin only saw a very frail old minister who shook
as he walked, as if his feet were striking against stones.
He was to depart on the morrow to the place of his
birth, but he came to the manse to wish his successor
God-speed. Strangers were so formidable to Margaret
that she only saw him from her window.</p>
<p>&#8220;May you never lose sight of God, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; the
old man said in the parlour. Then he added, as if he
had asked too much, &#8220;May you never turn from Him
as I often did when I was a lad like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>As this aged minister, with the beautiful face that
God gives to all who love Him and follow His commandments,
spoke of his youth, he looked wistfully
around the faded parlour.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is like a dream,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The first time I entered
this room the thought passed through me that I
would cut down that cherry-tree, because it kept out the
light, but, you see, it outlives me. I grew old while
looking for the axe. Only yesterday I was the young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
minister, Mr. Dishart, and to-morrow you will be the
old one, bidding good-bye to your successor.&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes came back to Gavin&#8217;s eager face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very young, Mr. Dishart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly twenty-one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-one! Ah, my dear sir, you do not know
how pathetic that sounds to me. Twenty-one! We are
children for the second time at twenty-one, and again
when we are grey and put all our burden on the Lord.
The young talk generously of relieving the old of their
burdens, but the anxious heart is to the old when they
see a load on the back of the young. Let me tell you,
Mr. Dishart, that I would condone many things in one-and-twenty
now that I dealt hardly with at middle age.
God Himself, I think, is very willing to give one-and-twenty
a second chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; Gavin said anxiously, &#8220;that I look
even younger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Mr. Carfrae answered, smiling, &#8220;that your
heart is as fresh as your face; and that is well. The
useless men are those who never change with the years.
Many views that I held to in my youth and long afterwards
are a pain to me now, and I am carrying away
from Thrums memories of errors into which I fell at
every stage of my ministry. When you are older you
will know that life is a long lesson in humility.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; he said nervously, &#8220;that you don&#8217;t sing the
Paraphrases?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Carfrae had not grown out of all his prejudices,
you see; indeed, if Gavin had been less bigoted than
he on this question they might have parted stiffly. The
old minister would rather have remained to die in his
pulpit than surrender it to one who read his sermons.
Others may blame him for this, but I must say here
plainly that I never hear a minister reading without
wishing to send him back to college.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I cannot deny,&#8221; Mr. Carfrae said, &#8220;that I broke
down more than once to-day. This forenoon I was in
Tillyloss, for the last time, and it so happens that there
is scarcely a house in it in which I have not had a marriage
or prayed over a coffin. Ah, sir, these are the
scenes that make the minister more than all his sermons.
You must join the family, Mr. Dishart, or you
are only a minister once a week. And remember this,
if your call is from above, it is a call to stay. Many such
partings in a lifetime as I have had to-day would be too
heartrending.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; Gavin said, hesitatingly, &#8220;they told me
in Glasgow that I had received a call from the mouth of
hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those were cruel words, but they only mean that
people who are seldom more than a day&#8217;s work in advance
of want sometimes rise in arms for food. Our
weavers are passionately religious, and so independent
that they dare any one to help them, but if their wages
were lessened they could not live. And so at talk of
reduction they catch fire. Change of any kind alarms
them, and though they call themselves Whigs, they
rose a few years ago over the paving of the streets and
stoned the workmen, who were strangers, out of the
town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And though you may have thought the place quiet
to-day, Mr. Dishart, there was an ugly outbreak only
two months ago, when the weavers turned on the manufacturers
for reducing the price of the web, made a
bonfire of some of their doors, and terrified one of them
into leaving Thrums. Under the command of some
Chartists, the people next paraded the streets to the
music of fife and drum, and six policemen who drove
up from Tilliedrum in a light cart were sent back tied
to the seats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one has been punished?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, but nearly two years ago there was a similar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
riot, and the sheriff took no action for months.
Then one night the square suddenly filled with soldiers,
and the ringleaders were seized in their beds. Mr. Dishart,
the people are determined not to be caught in that
way again, and ever since the rising a watch has been
kept by night on every road that leads to Thrums. The
signal that the soldiers are coming is to be the blowing
of a horn. If you ever hear that horn, I implore you
to hasten to the square.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The weavers would not fight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not know how the Chartists have fired this
part of the country. One misty day, a week ago, I was
on the hill; I thought I had it to myself, when suddenly
I heard a voice cry sharply, &#8216;Shoulder arms.&#8217; I could
see no one, and after a moment I put it down to a freak
of the wind. Then all at once the mist before me
blackened, and a body of men seemed to grow out of it.
They were not shadows; they were Thrums weavers
drilling, with pikes in their hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;They broke up,&#8221; Mr. Carfrae continued, after a
pause, &#8220;at my entreaty, but they have met again since
then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And there were Auld Lichts among them?&#8221; Gavin
asked. &#8220;I should have thought they would be frightened
at our precentor, Lang Tammas, who seems to
watch for backsliding in the congregation as if he had
pleasure in discovering it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin spoke with feeling, for the precentor had
already put him through his catechism, and it was a
stiff ordeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;The precentor!&#8221; said Mr. Carfrae. &#8220;Why, he was
one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old minister, once so brave a figure, tottered as
he rose to go, and reeled in a dizziness until he had
walked a few paces. Gavin went with him to the foot
of the manse road; without his hat, as all Thrums knew
before bedtime.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I begin,&#8221; Gavin said, as they were parting, &#8220;where
you leave off, and my prayer is that I may walk in your
ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; the white-haired minister said,
with a sigh, &#8220;the world does not progress so quickly as
a man grows old. You only begin where I began.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left Gavin, and then, as if the little minister&#8217;s
last words had hurt him, turned and solemnly pointed
his staff upward. Such men are the strong nails that
keep the world together.</p>
<p>The twenty-one-years-old minister returned to the
manse somewhat sadly, but when he saw his mother at
the window of her bedroom, his heart leapt at the
thought that she was with him and he had eighty pounds
a year. Gaily he waved both his hands to her, and she
answered with a smile, and then, in his boyishness, he
jumped over a gooseberry bush. Immediately afterwards
he reddened and tried to look venerable, for
while in the air he had caught sight of two women and
a man watching him from the dyke. He walked
severely to the door, and, again forgetting himself, was
bounding upstairs to Margaret, when Jean, the servant,
stood scandalised in his way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think she caught me,&#8221; was Gavin&#8217;s reflection,
and &#8220;The Lord preserve&#8217;s!&#8221; was Jean&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Gavin found his mother wondering how one should
set about getting a cup of tea in a house that had a
servant in it. He boldly rang the bell, and the willing
Jean answered it so promptly (in a rush and jump) that
Margaret was as much startled as Aladdin the first time
he rubbed his lamp.</p>
<p>Manse servants of the most admired kind move softly,
as if constant contact with a minister were goloshes to
them; but Jean was new and raw, only having got her
place because her father might be an elder any day.
She had already conceived a romantic affection for her
master; but to say &#8220;sir&#8221; to him&mdash;as she thirsted to do&mdash;would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
have been as difficult to her as to swallow
oysters. So anxious was she to please that when Gavin
rang she fired herself at the bedroom, but bells were
novelties to her as well as to Margaret, and she cried,
excitedly, &#8220;What is &#8217;t?&#8221; thinking the house must be on
fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a curran folk at the back door,&#8221; Jean announced
later, &#8220;and their respects to you, and would
you gie them some water out o&#8217; the well? It has been
a drouth this aucht days, and the pumps is locked.
Na,&#8221; she said, as Gavin made a too liberal offer, &#8220;that
would toom the well, and there&#8217;s jimply enough for
oursels. I should tell you, too, that three o&#8217; them is no
Auld Lichts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let that make no difference,&#8221; Gavin said grandly,
but Jean changed his message to: &#8220;A bowlful apiece to
Auld Lichts; all other denominations one cupful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, ay,&#8221; said Snecky Hobart, letting down the
bucket, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll include atheists among other denominations.&#8221;
The conversation came to Gavin and
Margaret through the kitchen doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinna class Jo Cruickshanks wi&#8217; me,&#8221; said Sam&#8217;l
Langlands the U. P.</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, na,&#8221; said Cruickshanks the atheist, &#8220;I&#8217;m ower
independent to be religious. I dinna gang to the kirk
to cry, &#8216;Oh, Lord, gie, gie, gie.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take tent o&#8217; yoursel&#8217;, my man,&#8221; said Lang Tammas
sternly, &#8220;or you&#8217;ll soon be whaur you would neifer
the warld for a cup o&#8217; that cauld water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ve ower keen an interest in the devil,
Tammas,&#8221; retorted the atheist; &#8220;but, ony way, if it&#8217;s
heaven for climate, it&#8217;s hell for company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lads,&#8221; said Snecky, sitting down on the bucket,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll send Mr. Dishart to Jo. He&#8217;ll make another
Rob Dow o&#8217; him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak mair reverently o&#8217; your minister,&#8221; said the
precentor. &#8220;He has the gift.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I hinna naturally your solemn rasping word, Tammas,
but in the heart I speak in all reverence. Lads,
the minister has a word! I tell you he prays near like
one giving orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At first,&#8221; Snecky continued, &#8220;I thocht yon lang
candidate was the earnestest o&#8217; them a&#8217;, and I dinna
deny but when I saw him wi&#8217; his head bowed-like in
prayer during the singing I says to mysel&#8217;, &#8216;Thou art
the man.&#8217; Ay, but Betsy wraxed up her head, and he
wasna praying. He was combing his hair wi&#8217; his fingers
on the sly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ken fine, Sneck,&#8221; said Cruickshanks, &#8220;that you
said, &#8216;Thou art the man&#8217; to ilka ane o&#8217; them, and just
voted for Mr. Dishart because he preached hinmost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didna say it to Mr. Urquhart, the ane that preached
second,&#8221; Sneck said. &#8220;That was the lad that gaed
through ither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said Susy Tibbits, nicknamed by Haggart
&#8220;the Timidest Woman&#8221; because she once said she was
too young to marry, &#8220;but I was fell sorry for him, just
being over anxious. He began bonny, flinging himself,
like ane inspired, at the pulpit door, but after Hendry
Munn pointed at it and cried out, &#8216;Be cautious, the
sneck&#8217;s loose,&#8217; he a&#8217; gaed to bits. What a coolness
Hendry has, though I suppose it was his duty, him
being kirk-officer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We didna want a man,&#8221; Lang Tammas said, &#8220;that
could be put out by sic a sma&#8217; thing as that. Mr.
Urquhart was in sic a ravel after it that when he gies
out the first line o&#8217; the hunder and nineteenth psalm for
singing, says he, &#8216;And so on to the end.&#8217; Ay, that finished
his chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The noblest o&#8217; them to look at,&#8221; said Tibbie Birse,
&#8220;was that ane frae Aberdeen, him that had sic a saft
side to Jacob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said Snecky, &#8220;and I speired at Dr. McQueen
if I should vote for him. &#8216;Looks like a genius, does
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
he?&#8217; says the Doctor. &#8216;Weel, then,&#8217; says he, &#8216;dinna
vote for him, for my experience is that there&#8217;s no folk
sic idiots as them that looks like geniuses.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sal,&#8221; Susy said, &#8220;it&#8217;s a guid thing we&#8217;ve settled,
for I enjoyed sitting like a judge upon them so muckle
that I sair doubt it was a kind o&#8217; sport to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was no sport to them, Susy, I&#8217;se uphaud, but it is
a blessing we&#8217;ve settled, and ondoubtedly we&#8217;ve got the
pick o&#8217; them. The only thing Mr. Dishart did that
made me oneasy was his saying the word Cæsar as if it
began wi&#8217; a <i>k</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll startle you mair afore you&#8217;re done wi&#8217; him,&#8221;
the atheist said maliciously. &#8220;I ken the ways o&#8217; thae
ministers preaching for kirks. Oh, they&#8217;re cunning.
You was a&#8217; pleased that Mr. Dishart spoke about looms
and webs, but, lathies, it was a trick. Ilka ane o&#8217; thae
young ministers has a sermon about looms for weaving
congregations, and a second about beating swords into
ploughshares for country places, and another on the
great catch of fishes for fishing villages. That&#8217;s their
stock-in-trade; and just you wait and see if you dinna
get the ploughshares and the fishes afore the month&#8217;s
out. A minister preaching for a kirk is one thing,
but a minister placed in&#8217;t may be a very different
berry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Joseph Cruickshanks,&#8221; cried the precentor, passionately,
&#8220;none o&#8217; your d&mdash;&mdash;d blasphemy!&#8221;</p>
<p>They all looked at Whamond, and he dug his teeth
into his lips in shame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&#8217;s swearing now?&#8221; said the atheist.</p>
<p>But Whamond was quick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Matthew, twelve and thirty-one,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dagont, Tammas,&#8221; exclaimed the baffled Cruickshanks,
&#8220;you&#8217;re aye quoting Scripture. How do you
no quote Feargus O&#8217;Connor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lads,&#8221; said Snecky, &#8220;Jo hasna heard Mr. Dishart&#8217;s
sermons. Ay, we get it scalding when he comes to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
sermon. I canna thole a minister that preaches as if
heaven was round the corner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re hitting at our minister, Snecky,&#8221; said
James Cochrane, &#8220;let me tell you he&#8217;s a better man
than yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A better curler, I dare say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A better prayer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, he can pray for a black frost as if it was ane o&#8217;
the Royal Family. I ken his prayers, &#8216;O Lord, let it
haud for anither day, and keep the snaw awa&#8217;.&#8217; Will
you pretend, Jeames, that Mr. Duthie could make onything
o&#8217; Rob Dow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I admit that Rob&#8217;s awakening was an extraordinary
thing, and sufficient to gie Mr. Dishart a name. But
Mr. Carfrae was baffled wi&#8217; Rob too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeames, if you had been in our kirk that day Mr.
Dishart preached for&#8217;t you would be wearying the now
for Sabbath, to be back in&#8217;t again. As you ken, that
wicked man there, Jo Cruickshanks, got Rob Dow,
drucken, cursing, poaching Rob Dow, to come to the
kirk to annoy the minister. Ay, he hadna been at that
work for ten minutes when Mr. Dishart stopped in his
first prayer and ga&#8217;e Rob a look. I couldna see the
look, being in the precentor&#8217;s box, but as sure as death
I felt it boring through me. Rob is hard wood, though,
and soon he was at his tricks again. Weel, the minister
stopped a second time in the sermon, and so awful
was the silence that a heap o&#8217; the congregation couldna
keep their seats. I heard Rob breathing quick and
strong. Mr. Dishart had his arm pointed at him a&#8217; this
time, and at last he says sternly, &#8216;Come forward.&#8217; Listen,
Joseph Cruickshanks, and tremble. Rob gripped
the board to keep himsel&#8217; frae obeying, and again Mr.
Dishart says, &#8216;Come forward,&#8217; and syne Rob rose shaking,
and tottered to the pulpit stair like a man suddenly
shot into the Day of Judgment. &#8216;You hulking man of
sin,&#8217; cries Mr. Dishart, not a tick fleid, though Rob&#8217;s as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
big as three o&#8217; him, &#8216;sit down on the stair and attend to
me, or I&#8217;ll step doun frae the pulpit and run you out of
the house of God.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And since that day,&#8221; said Hobart, &#8220;Rob has worshipped
Mr. Dishart as a man that has stepped out o&#8217;
the Bible. When the carriage passed this day we was
discussing the minister, and Sam&#8217;l Dickie wasna sure
but what Mr. Dishart wore his hat rather far back on
his head. You should have seen Rob. &#8216;My certie,&#8217;
he roars, &#8216;there&#8217;s the shine frae Heaven on that little
minister&#8217;s face, and them as says there&#8217;s no has me to
fecht.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, weel,&#8221; said the U. P., rising, &#8220;we&#8217;ll see how
Rob wears&mdash;and how your minister wears too. I
wouldna like to sit in a kirk whaur they daurna sing a
paraphrase.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Psalms of David,&#8221; retorted Whamond, &#8220;mount
straight to heaven, but your paraphrases sticks to the
ceiling o&#8217; the kirk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a bigoted set, Tammas Whamond, but I
tell you this, and it&#8217;s my last words to you the nicht,
the day&#8217;ll come when you&#8217;ll hae Mr. Duthie, ay, and
even the U. P. minister, preaching in the Auld Licht
kirk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And let this be my last words to you,&#8221; replied the
precentor, furiously; &#8220;that rather than see a U. P.
preaching in the Auld Licht kirk I would burn in hell
fire for ever!&#8221;</p>
<p>This gossip increased Gavin&#8217;s knowledge of the grim
men with whom he had now to deal. But as he sat beside
Margaret after she had gone to bed, their talk was
pleasant.</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember, mother,&#8221; Gavin said, &#8220;how I almost
prayed for the manse that was to give you an egg every
morning. I have been telling Jean never to forget the
egg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Gavin, things have come about so much as we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
wanted that I&#8217;m a kind o&#8217; troubled. It&#8217;s hardly natural,
and I hope nothing terrible is to happen now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin arranged her pillows as she liked them, and
when he next stole into the room in his stocking soles
to look at her, he thought she was asleep. But she was
not. I dare say she saw at that moment Gavin in his
first frock, and Gavin in knickerbockers, and Gavin as
he used to walk into the Glasgow room from college, all
still as real to her as the Gavin who had a kirk.</p>
<p>The little minister took away the lamp to his own
room, shaking his fist at himself for allowing his
mother&#8217;s door to creak. He pulled up his blind. The
town lay as still as salt. But a steady light showed in
the south, and on pressing his face against the window
he saw another in the west. Mr. Carfrae&#8217;s words about
the night-watch came back to him. Perhaps it had
been on such a silent night as this that the soldiers
marched into Thrums. Would they come again?</p>

<h2>Chapter Four.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />FIRST COMING OF THE EGYPTIAN WOMAN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>A learned man says in a book, otherwise beautiful
with truth, that villages are family groups. To him
Thrums would only be a village, though town is the
word we have ever used, and this is not true of it.
Doubtless we have interests in common, from which a
place so near (but the road is heavy) as Tilliedrum is
shut out, and we have an individuality of our own too,
as if, like our red houses, we came from a quarry that
supplies no other place. But we are not one family.
In the old days, those of us who were of the Tenements
seldom wandered to the Croft head, and if we did go
there we saw men to whom we could not always give a
name. To flit from the Tanage brae to Haggart&#8217;s road
was to change one&#8217;s friends. A kirk-wynd weaver
might kill his swine and Tillyloss not know of it until
boys ran westward hitting each other with the bladders.
Only the voice of the dulsemen could be heard all over
Thrums at once. Thus even in a small place but a few
outstanding persons are known to everybody.</p>
<p>In eight days Gavin&#8217;s figure was more familiar in
Thrums than many that had grown bent in it. He had
already been twice to the cemetery, for a minister only
reaches his new charge in time to attend a funeral.
Though short of stature he cast a great shadow. He
was so full of his duties, Jean said, that though he pulled
to the door as he left the manse, he had passed the currant
bushes before it snecked. He darted through
courts, and invented ways into awkward houses. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
you did not look up quickly he was round the corner.
His visiting exhausted him only less than his zeal in the
pulpit, from which, according to report, he staggered
damp with perspiration to the vestry, where Hendry
Munn wrung him like a wet cloth. A deaf lady, celebrated
for giving out her washing, compelled him to
hold her trumpet until she had peered into all his crannies,
with the Shorter Catechism for a lantern. Janet
Dundas told him, in answer to his knock, that she could
not abide him, but she changed her mind when he said
her garden was quite a show. The wives who expected
a visit scrubbed their floors for him, cleaned out their
presses for him, put diamond socks on their bairns for
him, rubbed their hearthstones blue for him, and even
tidied up the garret for him, and triumphed over the
neighbours whose houses he passed by. For Gavin
blundered occasionally by inadvertence, as when he
gave dear old Betty Davie occasion to say bitterly&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ou ay, you can sail by my door and gang to Easie&#8217;s,
but I&#8217;m thinking you would stop at mine too if I had a
brass handle on&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>So passed the first four weeks, and then came the
fateful night of the seventeenth of October, and with it
the strange woman. Family worship at the manse was
over and Gavin was talking to his mother, who never
crossed the threshold save to go to church (though her
activity at home was among the marvels Jean sometimes
slipped down to the Tenements to announce),
when Wearyworld the policeman came to the door
&#8220;with Rob Dow&#8217;s compliments, and if you&#8217;re no wi&#8217;
me by ten o&#8217;clock I&#8217;m to break out again.&#8221; Gavin
knew what this meant, and at once set off for Rob&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll let me gang a bit wi&#8217; you,&#8221; the policeman
entreated, &#8220;for till Rob sent me on this errand not a
soul has spoken to me the day; ay, mony a ane hae I
spoken to, but not a man, woman, nor bairn would fling
me a word.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I often meant to ask you,&#8221; Gavin said as they went
along the Tenements, which smelled at that hour of
roasted potatoes, &#8220;why you are so unpopular.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because I&#8217;m police. I&#8217;m the first ane that has
ever been in Thrums, and the very folk that appointed
me at a crown a week looks upon me as a disgraced man
for accepting. It&#8217;s Gospel that my ain wife is short wi&#8217;
me when I&#8217;ve on my uniform, though weel she kens
that I would rather hae stuck to the loom if I hadna
ha&#8217;en sic a queer richt leg. Nobody feels the shame o&#8217;
my position as I do mysel&#8217;, but this is a town without
pity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It should be a consolation to you that you are discharging
useful duties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m no. I&#8217;m doing harm. There&#8217;s Charles
Dickson says that the very sicht o&#8217; my uniform rouses
his dander so muckle that it makes him break windows,
though a peaceably-disposed man till I was appointed.
And what&#8217;s the use o&#8217; their haeing a policeman when
they winna come to the lock-up after I lay hands on
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they say they won&#8217;t come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say? Catch them saying onything! They just gie
me a wap into the gutters. If they would speak I
wouldna complain, for I&#8217;m nat&#8217;rally the sociablest man in
Thrums.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rob, however, had spoken to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he had need o&#8217; me. That was ay Rob&#8217;s way,
converted or no converted. When he was blind drunk
he would order me to see him safe hame, but would he
crack wi&#8217; me? Na, na.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wearyworld, who was so called because of his forlorn
way of muttering, &#8220;It&#8217;s a weary warld, and nobody
bides in&#8217;t,&#8221; as he went his melancholy rounds, sighed
like one about to cry, and Gavin changed the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the watch for the soldiers still kept up?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, but the watchers winna let me in aside them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
I&#8217;ll let you see that for yoursel&#8217; at the head o&#8217; the
Roods, for they watch there in the auld windmill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of the Thrums lights were already out, and that
in the windmill disappeared as footsteps were heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re desperate characters,&#8221; the policeman cried,
but got no answer. He changed his tactics.</p>
<p>&#8220;A fine nicht for the time o&#8217; year,&#8221; he cried. No
answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I wouldna wonder,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;though we
had rain afore morning.&#8221; No answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely you could gie me a word frae ahint the door.
You&#8217;re doing an onlawful thing, but I dinna ken wha
you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll swear to that?&#8221; some one asked gruffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I swear to it, Peter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wearyworld tried another six remarks in vain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; he said to the minister, &#8220;that&#8217;s what it is to
be an onpopular man. And now I&#8217;ll hae to turn back,
for the very anes that winna let me join them would be
the first to complain if I gaed out o&#8217; bounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin found Dow at New Zealand, a hamlet of mud
houses, whose tenants could be seen on any Sabbath
morning washing themselves in the burn that trickled
hard by. Rob&#8217;s son, Micah, was asleep at the door, but
he brightened when he saw who was shaking him.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father put me out,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;because
he&#8217;s daft for the drink, and was fleid he would curse
me. He hasna cursed me,&#8221; Micah added, proudly, &#8220;for
an aught days come Sabbath. Hearken to him at his
loom. He daurna take his feet off the treadles for fear
o&#8217; running straucht to the drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin went in. The loom, and two stools, the one
four-footed and the other a buffet, were Rob&#8217;s most
conspicuous furniture. A shaving-strap hung on the
wall. The fire was out, but the trunk of a tree, charred
at one end, showed how he heated his house. He made
a fire of peat, and on it placed one end of a tree trunk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
that might be six feet long. As the tree burned away
it was pushed further into the fireplace, and a roaring
fire could always be got by kicking pieces of the smouldering
wood and blowing them into flame with the bellows.
When Rob saw the minister he groaned relief
and left his loom. He had been weaving, his teeth
clenched, his eyes on fire, for seven hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasna fleid,&#8221; little Micah said to the neighbours
afterwards, &#8220;to gang in wi&#8217; the minister. He&#8217;s a fine
man that. He didna ca&#8217; my father names. Na, he
said, &#8216;You&#8217;re a brave fellow, Rob,&#8217; and he took my
father&#8217;s hand, he did. My father was shaking after his
fecht wi&#8217; the drink, and, says he, &#8216;Mr. Dishart,&#8217; he
says, &#8216;if you&#8217;ll let me break out nows and nans, I could
bide straucht atween times, but I canna keep sober if I
hinna a drink to look forrit to.&#8217; Ay, my father prigged
sair to get one fou day in the month, and he said, &#8216;Syne
if I die sudden, there&#8217;s thirty chances to one that I gang
to heaven, so it&#8217;s worth risking.&#8217; But Mr. Dishart
wouldna hear o&#8217;t, and he cries, &#8216;No, by God,&#8217; he cries,
&#8216;we&#8217;ll wrestle wi&#8217; the devil till we throttle him,&#8217; and
down him and my father gaed on their knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;The minister prayed a lang time till my father said
his hunger for the drink was gone, &#8216;but&#8217;, he says, &#8216;it
swells up in me o&#8217; a sudden aye, and it may be back
afore you&#8217;re hame.&#8217; &#8216;Then come to me at once,&#8217; says
Mr. Dishart; but my father says, &#8216;Na, for it would
haul me into the public-house as if it had me at the end
o&#8217; a rope, but I&#8217;ll send the laddie.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw my father crying the minister back? It
was to gie him twa pound, and, says my father, &#8216;God
helping me,&#8217; he says, &#8216;I&#8217;ll droon mysel in the dam
rather than let the drink master me, but in case it
should get haud o&#8217; me and I should die drunk, it would
be a michty gratification to me to ken that you had the
siller to bury me respectable without ony help frae the
poor&#8217;s rates.&#8217; The minister wasna for taking it at first,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
but he took it when he saw how earnest my father was.
Ay, he&#8217;s a noble man. After he gaed awa my father
made me learn the names o&#8217; the apostles frae Luke
sixth, and he says to me, &#8216;Miss out Bartholomew,&#8217; he
says, &#8216;for he did little, and put Gavin Dishart in his
place.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Feeling as old as he sometimes tried to look, Gavin
turned homeward. Margaret was already listening for
him. You may be sure she knew his step. I think
our steps vary as much as the human face. My bookshelves
were made by a blind man who could identify
by their steps nearly all who passed his window. Yet
he has admitted to me that he could not tell wherein my
steps differed from others; and this I believe, though
rejecting his boast that he could distinguish a minister&#8217;s
step from a doctor&#8217;s, and even tell to which denomination
the minister belonged.</p>
<p>I have sometimes asked myself what would have been
Gavin&#8217;s future had he gone straight home that night
from Dow&#8217;s. He would doubtless have seen the Egyptian
before morning broke, but she would not have come
upon him like a witch. There are, I dare say, many
lovers who would never have been drawn to each other
had they met for the first time, as, say, they met the
second time. But such dreaming is to no purpose.
Gavin met Sanders Webster, the mole-catcher, and was
persuaded by him to go home by Caddam Wood.</p>
<p>Gavin took the path to Caddam, because Sanders told
him the Wild Lindsays were there, a gypsy family that
threatened the farmers by day and danced devilishly,
it was said, at night. The little minister knew them
by repute as a race of giants, and that not many persons
would have cared to face them alone at midnight; but
he was feeling as one wound up to heavy duties, and
meant to admonish them severely.</p>
<p>Sanders, an old man who lived with his sister Nanny
on the edge of the wood, went with him, and for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
time both were silent. But Sanders had something to
say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was you ever at the Spittal, Mr. Dishart?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Rintoul&#8217;s house at the top of Glen Quharity?
No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hae you ever looked on a lord?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or on an auld lord&#8217;s young leddyship? I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You surely ken that Rintoul&#8217;s auld, and is to be
married on a young leddyship. She&#8217;s no&#8217; a leddyship
yet, but they&#8217;re to be married soon, so I may say I&#8217;ve
seen a leddyship. Ay, an impressive sicht. It was
yestreen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a great difference in their ages?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As muckle as atween auld Peter Spens and his wife,
wha was saxteen when he was saxty, and she was playing
at dumps in the street when her man was waiting
for her to make his porridge. Ay, sic a differ doesna
suit wi&#8217; common folk, but of course earls can please
themsels. Rintoul&#8217;s so fond o&#8217; the leddyship &#8217;at is to
be, that when she was at the school in Edinbury he
wrote to her ilka day. Kaytherine Crummie telled me
that, and she says aince you&#8217;re used to it, writing letters
is as easy as skinning moles. I dinna ken what
they can write sic a heap about, but I daur say he gies
her his views on the Chartist agitation and the potato
disease, and she&#8217;ll write back about the romantic sichts
o&#8217; Edinbury and the sermons o&#8217; the grand preachers she
hears. Sal, though, thae grand folk has no religion to
speak o&#8217;, for they&#8217;re a&#8217; English kirk. You&#8217;re no&#8217; speiring
what her leddyship said to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did she say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, you see, there was a dancing ball on, and
Kaytherine Crummie took me to a window whaur I
could stand on a flower-pot and watch the critturs whirling
round in the ball like teetotums. What&#8217;s mair, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
pointed out the leddyship that&#8217;s to be to me, and I just
glowered at her, for thinks I, &#8216;Take your fill, Sanders,
and whaur there&#8217;s lords and leddyships, dinna waste a
minute on colonels and honourable misses and sic like
dirt.&#8217; Ay, but what wi&#8217; my een blinking at the blaze
o&#8217; candles, I lost sicht o&#8217; her till all at aince somebody
says at my lug, &#8216;Well, my man, and who is the prettiest
lady in the room?&#8217; Mr. Dishart, it was her leddyship.
She looked like a star.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what did you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The first thing I did was to fall aff the flower-pot;
but syne I came to, and says I, wi&#8217; a polite smirk, &#8216;I&#8217;m
thinking your leddyship,&#8217; says I, &#8216;as you&#8217;re the bonniest
yourself.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you are a cute man, Sanders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but that&#8217;s no&#8217; a&#8217;. She lauched in a pleased way
and tapped me wi&#8217; her fan, and says she, &#8216;Why do you
think me the prettiest?&#8217; I dinna deny but what that
staggered me, but I thocht a minute, and took a look
at the other dancers again, and syne I says, michty
sly like, &#8216;The other leddies,&#8217; I says, &#8216;has sic sma&#8217;
feet.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sanders stopped here and looked doubtingly at Gavin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I canna make up my mind,&#8221; he said, &#8220;whether she
liked that, for she rapped my knuckles wi&#8217; her fan fell
sair, and aff she gaed. Ay, I consulted Tammas Haggart
about it, and he says, &#8216;The flirty crittur,&#8217; he says.
What would you say, Mr. Dishart?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin managed to escape without giving an answer,
for here their roads separated. He did not find the
Wild Lindsays, however. Children of whim, of prodigious
strength while in the open, but destined to
wither quickly in the hot air of towns, they had gone
from Caddam, leaving nothing of themselves behind
but a black mark burned by their fires into the ground.
Thus they branded the earth through many counties
until some hour when the spirit of wandering again fell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
on them, and they forsook their hearths with as little
compunction as the bird leaves its nest.</p>
<p>Gavin had walked quickly, and he now stood silently
in the wood, his hat in his hand. In the moonlight
the grass seemed tipped with hoar frost. Most of the
beeches were already bare, but the shoots, clustering
round them, like children at their mother&#8217;s skirts, still
retained their leaves red and brown. Among the pines
these leaves were as incongruous as a wedding-dress at a
funeral. Gavin was standing on grass, but there were
patches of heather within sight, and broom, and the
leaf of the blaeberry. Where the beeches had drawn
up the earth with them as they grew, their roots ran
this way and that, slippery to the feet and looking like
disinterred bones. A squirrel appeared suddenly on
the charred ground, looked doubtfully at Gavin to see
if he was growing there, and then glided up a tree,
where it sat eyeing him, and forgetting to conceal its
shadow. Caddam was very still. At long intervals
came from far away the whack of an axe on wood.
Gavin was in a world by himself, and this might be
some one breaking into it.</p>
<p>The mystery of woods by moonlight thrilled the little
minister. His eyes rested on the shining roots, and he
remembered what had been told him of the legend of
Caddam, how once on a time it was a mighty wood, and
a maiden most beautiful stood on its confines, panting
and afraid, for a wicked man pursued her; how he drew
near, and she ran a little way into the wood, and he followed
her, and she still ran, and still he followed, until
both were for ever lost, and the bones of her pursuer
lie beneath a beech, but the lady may still be heard
singing in the woods if the night be fine, for then she
is a glad spirit, but weeping when there is wild wind,
for then she is but a mortal seeking a way out of the
wood.</p>

IN CADDAM WOOD.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>The squirrel slid down the fir and was gone. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
axe&#8217;s blows ceased. Nothing that moved was in sight.
The wind that has its nest in trees was circling around
with many voices, that never rose above a whisper, and
were often but the echo of a sigh.</p>
<p>Gavin was in the Caddam of past days, where the
beautiful maiden wanders ever, waiting for him who is
so pure that he may find her. He will wander over the
tree-tops looking for her, with the moon for his lamp,
and some night he will hear her singing. The little
minister drew a deep breath, and his foot snapped a
brittle twig. Then he remembered who and where he
was, and stooped to pick up his staff. But he did not
pick it up, for as his fingers were closing on it the lady
began to sing.</p>
<p>For perhaps a minute Gavin stood stock still, like
an intruder. Then he ran towards the singing, which
seemed to come from Windyghoul, a straight road
through Caddam that farmers use in summer, but leave
in the back end of the year to leaves and pools. In
Windyghoul there is either no wind or so much that it
rushes down the sieve like an army, entering with a
shriek of terror, and escaping with a derisive howl.
The moon was crossing the avenue. But Gavin only
saw the singer.</p>
<p>She was still fifty yards away, sometimes singing
gleefully, and again letting her body sway lightly as she
came dancing up Windyghoul. Soon she was within a
few feet of the little minister, to whom singing, except
when out of tune, was a suspicious thing, and dancing
a device of the devil. His arm went out wrathfully,
and his intention was to pronounce sentence on this
woman.</p>
<p>But she passed, unconscious of his presence, and he
had not moved nor spoken. Though really of the average
height, she was a little thing to the eyes of Gavin,
who always felt tall and stout except when he looked
down. The grace of her swaying figure was a new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
thing in the world to him. Only while she passed did
he see her as a gleam of colour, a gypsy elf poorly clad,
her bare feet flashing beneath a short green skirt, a
twig of rowan berries stuck carelessly into her black
hair. Her face was pale. She had an angel&#8217;s loveliness.
Gavin shook.</p>
<p>Still she danced onwards, but she was very human,
for when she came to muddy water she let her feet linger
in it, and flung up her arms, dancing more wantonly
than before. A diamond on her finger shot a thread of
fire over the pool. Undoubtedly she was the devil.</p>
<p>Gavin leaped into the avenue, and she heard him and
looked behind. He tried to cry &#8220;Woman!&#8221; sternly,
but lost the word, for now she saw him, and laughed
with her shoulders, and beckoned to him, so that he
shook his fist at her. She tripped on, but often turning
her head beckoned and mocked him, and he forgot
his dignity and his pulpit and all other things, and ran
after her. Up Windyghoul did he pursue her, and it
was well that the precentor was not there to see. She
reached the mouth of the avenue, and kissing her hand
to Gavin, so that the ring gleamed again, was gone.</p>
<p>The minister&#8217;s one thought was to find her, but he
searched in vain. She might be crossing the hill on
her way to Thrums, or perhaps she was still laughing
at him from behind a tree. After a longer time than
he was aware of, Gavin realised that his boots were
chirping and his trousers streaked with mud. Then he
abandoned the search and hastened homewards in a
rage.</p>

IN WINDYGHOUL.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>From the hill to the manse the nearest way is down
two fields, and the little minister descended them
rapidly. Thrums, which is red in daylight, was grey
and still as the cemetery. He had glimpses of several
of its deserted streets. To the south the watch-light
showed brightly, but no other was visible. So it seemed
to Gavin, and then&mdash;suddenly&mdash;he lost the power to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
move. He had heard the horn. Thrice it sounded,
and thrice it struck him to the heart. He looked again
and saw a shadow stealing along the Tenements, then
another, then half-a-dozen. He remembered Mr. Carfrae&#8217;s
words, &#8220;If you ever hear that horn, I implore you
to hasten to the square,&#8221; and in another minute he had
reached the Tenements.</p>
<p>Now again he saw the gypsy. She ran past him,
half-a-score of men, armed with staves and pikes, at
her heels. At first he thought they were chasing her,
but they were following her as a leader. Her eyes
sparkled as she waved them to the square with her arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The soldiers, the soldiers!&#8221; was the universal cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is that woman?&#8221; demanded Gavin, catching
hold of a frightened old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curse the Egyptian limmer,&#8221; the man answered,
&#8220;she&#8217;s egging my laddie on to fecht.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless her rather,&#8221; the son cried, &#8220;for warning us
that the sojers is coming. Put your ear to the ground,
Mr. Dishart, and you&#8217;ll hear the dirl o&#8217; their feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man rushed away to the square, flinging
his father from him. Gavin followed. As he turned
into the school wynd, the town drum began to beat,
windows were thrown open, and sullen men ran out of
closes where women were screaming and trying to hold
them back. At the foot of the wynd Gavin passed
Sanders Webster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dishart,&#8221; the mole-catcher cried, &#8220;hae you seen
that Egyptian? May I be struck dead if it&#8217;s no&#8217; her
little leddyship.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Gavin did not hear him.</p>

</div>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dishart!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jean had clutched at Gavin in Bank Street. Her
hair was streaming, and her wrapper but half buttoned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Dishart, look at the mistress! I couldna
keep her in the manse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin saw his mother beside him, bare-headed,
trembling.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I sit still, Gavin, and the town full o&#8217;
the skirls of women and bairns? Oh, Gavin, what can I
do for them? They will suffer most this night.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Gavin took her hand he knew that Margaret felt
for the people more than he.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you must go home, mother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
leave me to do my duty. I will take you myself if you
will not go with Jean. Be careful of her, Jean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, will I,&#8221; Jean answered, then burst into tears.
&#8220;Mr. Dishart,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;if they take my father they&#8217;d
best take my mither too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two women went back to the manse, where Jean
relit the fire, having nothing else to do, and boiled the
kettle, while Margaret wandered in anguish from room
to room.</p>

THE WARNING.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Men nearly naked ran past Gavin, seeking to escape
from Thrums by the fields he had descended. When
he shouted to them they only ran faster. A Tillyloss
weaver whom he tried to stop struck him savagely and
sped past to the square. In Bank Street, which was full
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
of people at one moment and empty the next, the minister
stumbled over old Charles Yuill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take me and welcome,&#8221; Yuill cried, mistaking
Gavin for the enemy. He had only one arm through
the sleeve of his jacket, and his feet were bare.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Mr. Dishart. Are the soldiers already in the
square, Yuill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be there in a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man was so weak that Gavin had to hold
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be a man, Charles. You have nothing to fear. It
is not such as you the soldiers have come for. If need
be, I can swear that you had not the strength, even if
you had the will, to join in the weavers&#8217; riot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For Godsake, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; Yuill cried, his hands
chattering on Gavin&#8217;s coat, &#8220;dinna swear that. My
laddie was in the thick o&#8217; the riot; and if he&#8217;s ta&#8217;en
there&#8217;s the poor&#8217;s-house gaping for Kitty and me, for I
couldna weave half a web a week. If there&#8217;s a warrant
agin onybody o&#8217; the name of Yuill, swear it&#8217;s me;
swear I&#8217;m a desperate character, swear I&#8217;m michty
strong for all I look palsied; and if when they take me,
my courage breaks down, swear the mair, swear I confessed
my guilt to you on the Book.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Yuill spoke the quick rub-a-dub of a drum was
heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;The soldiers!&#8221; Gavin let go his hold of the old man,
who hastened away to give himself up.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no the sojers,&#8221; said a woman; &#8220;it&#8217;s the folk
gathering in the square. This&#8217;ll be a watery Sabbath
in Thrums.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rob Dow,&#8221; shouted Gavin, as Dow flung past with
a scythe in his hand, &#8220;lay down that scythe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To hell wi&#8217; religion!&#8221; Rob retorted, fiercely; &#8220;it
spoils a&#8217; thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lay down that scythe; I command you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rob stopped undecidedly, then cast the scythe from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
him, but its rattle on the stones was more than he could
bear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I winna,&#8221; he cried, and, picking it up, ran to the
square.</p>
<p>An upper window in Bank Street opened, and Dr.
McQueen put out his head. He was smoking as usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dishart,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you will return home at
once if you are a wise man; or, better still, come in
here. You can do nothing with these people to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can stop their fighting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will only make black blood between them and
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinna heed him, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; cried some women.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better heed him,&#8221; cried a man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not desert my people,&#8221; Gavin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, then, to my prescription,&#8221; the doctor replied.
&#8220;Drive that gypsy lassie out of the town before
the soldiers reach it. She is firing the men to a red-heat
through sheer devilry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She brocht the news, or we would have been nipped
in our beds,&#8221; some people cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does any one know who she is?&#8221; Gavin demanded,
but all shook their heads. The Egyptian, as they
called her, had never been seen in these parts before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has any other person seen the soldiers?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Perhaps this is a false alarm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Several have seen them within the last few minutes,&#8221;
the doctor answered. &#8220;They came from Tilliedrum,
and were advancing on us from the south, but
when they heard that we had got the alarm they stopped
at the top of the brae, near T&#8217;nowhead&#8217;s farm. Man,
you would take these things more coolly if you smoked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Show me this woman,&#8221; Gavin said sternly to those
who had been listening. Then a stream of people
carried him into the square.</p>
<p>The square has altered little, even in these days of
enterprise, when Tillyloss has become Newton Bank,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
and the Craft Head Croft Terrace, with enamelled
labels on them for the guidance of slow people, who
forget their address and have to run to the end of the
street and look up every time they write a letter. The
stones on which the butter-wives sat have disappeared,
and with them the clay walls and the outside stairs.
Gone, too, is the stair of the town-house, from the top
of which the drummer roared the gossip of the week on
Sabbaths to country folk, to the scandal of all who knew
that the proper thing on that day is to keep your blinds
down; but the town-house itself, round and red, still
makes exit to the south troublesome. Wherever streets
meet the square there is a house in the centre of them,
and thus the heart of Thrums is a box, in which the
stranger finds himself suddenly, wondering at first how
he is to get out, and presently how he got in.</p>
<p>To Gavin, who never before had seen a score of people
in the square at once, here was a sight strange and
terrible. Andrew Struthers, an old soldier, stood on
the outside stair of the town-house, shouting words of
command to some fifty weavers, many of them scantily
clad, but all armed with pikes and poles. Most were
known to the little minister, but they wore faces that
were new to him. Newcomers joined the body every
moment. If the drill was clumsy the men were fierce.
Hundreds of people gathered around, some screaming,
some shaking their fists at the old soldier, many trying
to pluck their relatives out of danger. Gavin could not
see the Egyptian. Women and old men, fighting for
the possession of his ear, implored him to disperse the
armed band. He ran up the town-house stair, and in a
moment it had become a pulpit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinna dare to interfere, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; Struthers
said savagely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Andrew Struthers,&#8221; said Gavin solemnly, &#8220;in the
name of God I order you to leave me alone. If you don&#8217;t,&#8221;
he added ferociously, &#8220;I&#8217;ll fling you over the stair.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Dinna heed him, Andrew,&#8221; some one shouted, and
another cried, &#8220;He canna understand our sufferings;
he has dinner ilka day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Struthers faltered, however, and Gavin cast his eye
over the armed men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rob Dow,&#8221; he said, &#8220;William Carmichael, Thomas
Whamond, William Munn, Alexander Hobart, Henders
Haggart, step forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>These were Auld Lichts, and when they found that
the minister would not take his eyes off them, they
obeyed, all save Rob Dow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind him, Rob,&#8221; said the atheist, Cruickshanks,
&#8220;it&#8217;s better playing cards in hell than singing
psalms in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Joseph Cruickshanks,&#8221; responded Gavin grimly,
&#8220;you will find no cards down there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Rob also came to the foot of the stair. There
was some angry muttering from the crowd, and young
Charles Yuill exclaimed, &#8220;Curse you, would you lord
it ower us on week-days as weel as on Sabbaths?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lay down your weapons,&#8221; Gavin said to the six men.</p>
<p>They looked at each other. Hobart slipped his pike
behind his back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hae no weapon,&#8221; he said slily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me hae my fling this nicht,&#8221; Dow entreated,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll promise to bide sober for a twelvemonth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Rob, Rob!&#8221; the minister said bitterly, &#8220;are
you the man I prayed with a few hours ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>The scythe fell from Rob&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Down wi&#8217; your pikes,&#8221; he roared to his companions,
&#8220;or I&#8217;ll brain you wi&#8217; them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, lay them down,&#8221; the precentor whispered, &#8220;but
keep your feet on them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the minister, who was shaking with excitement,
though he did not know it, stretched forth his arms for
silence, and it came so suddenly as to frighten the people
in the neighboring streets.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If he prays we&#8217;re done for,&#8221; cried young Charles
Yuill, but even in that hour many of the people were
unbonneted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Thou who art the Lord of hosts,&#8221; Gavin prayed,
&#8220;we are in Thy hands this night. These are Thy people,
and they have sinned; but Thou art a merciful God,
and they were sore tried, and knew not what they did.
To Thee, our God, we turn for deliverance, for without
Thee we are lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little minister&#8217;s prayer was heard all round the
square, and many weapons were dropped as an Amen
to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you fight,&#8221; cried Gavin, brightening as he heard
the clatter of the iron on the stones, &#8220;your wives and
children may be shot in the streets. These soldiers
have come for a dozen of you; will you be benefited if
they take away a hundred?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hearken to him,&#8221; cried many women.</p>
<p>&#8220;I winna,&#8221; answered a man, &#8220;for I&#8217;m ane o&#8217; the
dozen. Whaur&#8217;s the Egyptian?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin saw the crowd open, and the woman of Windyghoul
come out of it, and, while he should have denounced
her, he only blinked, for once more her
loveliness struck him full in the eyes. She was beside
him on the stair before he became a minister again.</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you, woman?&#8221; he cried; but she flung a
rowan berry at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were a man,&#8221; she exclaimed, addressing the
people, &#8220;I wouldna let myself be catched like a mouse
in a trap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We winna,&#8221; some answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind o&#8217; women are you,&#8221; cried the Egyptian,
her face gleaming as she turned to her own sex, &#8220;that
bid your men folk gang to gaol when a bold front would
lead them to safety? Do you want to be husbandless
and hameless?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Disperse, I command you!&#8221; cried Gavin. &#8220;This
abandoned woman is inciting you to riot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinna heed this little man,&#8221; the Egyptian retorted.</p>
<p>It is curious to know that even at that anxious moment
Gavin winced because she called him little.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has the face of a mischief-maker,&#8221; he shouted,
&#8220;and her words are evil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You men and women o&#8217; Thrums,&#8221; she responded,
&#8220;ken that I wish you weel by the service I hae done
you this nicht. Wha telled you the sojers was coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was you; it was you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, and mony a mile I ran to bring the news.
Listen, and I&#8217;ll tell you mair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has a false tongue,&#8221; Gavin cried; &#8220;listen not
to the brazen woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What I have to tell,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is as true as what
I&#8217;ve telled already, and how true that is you a&#8217; ken.
You&#8217;re wondering how the sojers has come to a stop at
the tap o&#8217; the brae instead o&#8217; marching on the town.
Here&#8217;s the reason. They agreed to march straucht to
the square if the alarm wasna given, but if it was they
were to break into small bodies and surround the town
so that you couldna get out. That&#8217;s what they&#8217;re doing
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this the screams were redoubled, and many men
lifted the weapons they had dropped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Believe her not,&#8221; cried Gavin. &#8220;How could a wandering
gypsy know all this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, how can you ken?&#8221; some demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s enough that I do ken,&#8221; the Egyptian answered.
&#8220;And this mair I ken, that the captain of the soldiers is
confident he&#8217;ll nab every one o&#8217; you that&#8217;s wanted unless
you do one thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is &#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you a&#8217; run different ways you&#8217;re lost, but if you
keep thegither you&#8217;ll be able to force a road into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
country, whaur you can scatter. That&#8217;s what he&#8217;s fleid
you&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s what we will do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is what you will not do,&#8221; Gavin said passionately.
&#8220;The truth is not in this wicked woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>But scarcely had he spoken when he knew that startling
news had reached the square. A murmur arose
on the skirts of the mob, and swept with the roar of the
sea towards the town-house. A detachment of the soldiers
were marching down the Roods from the north.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some coming frae the east-town end,&#8221; was
the next intelligence; &#8220;and they&#8217;ve gripped Sanders
Webster, and auld Charles Yuill has given himsel&#8217; up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, you see,&#8221; the gypsy said, flashing triumph
at Gavin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lay down your weapons,&#8221; Gavin cried, but his
power over the people had gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Egyptian spoke true,&#8221; they shouted; &#8220;dinna
heed the minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin tried to seize the gypsy by the shoulders, but
she slipped past him down the stair, and crying &#8220;Follow
me!&#8221; ran round the town-house and down the brae.</p>
<p>&#8220;Woman!&#8221; he shouted after her, but she only waved
her arms scornfully. The people followed her, many
of the men still grasping their weapons, but all in disorder.
Within a minute after Gavin saw the gleam of the
ring on her finger, as she waved her hands, he and Dow
were alone in the square.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an awfu&#8217; woman that,&#8221; Rob said. &#8220;I saw her
lauching.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin ground his teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rob Dow,&#8221; he said, slowly, &#8220;if I had not found
Christ I would have throttled that woman. You saw
how she flouted me?&#8221;</p>

<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />IN WHICH THE SOLDIERS MEET THE AMAZONS OF THRUMS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Dow looked shamefacedly at the minister, and then
set off up the square.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going, Rob?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To gie myself up. I maun do something to let you
see there&#8217;s one man in Thrums that has mair faith in
you than in a fliskmahoy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And only one, Rob. But I don&#8217;t know that they
want to arrest you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I had a hand in tying the polissman to the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to hear nothing about that,&#8221; Gavin said,
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will I hide, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare not advise you to do that. It would be wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half a score of fugitives tore past the town-house,
and were out of sight without a cry. There was a tread
of heavier feet, and a dozen soldiers, with several
policemen and two prisoners, appeared suddenly on the
north side of the square.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rob,&#8221; cried the minister in desperation, &#8220;run!&#8221;</p>
<p>When the soldiers reached the town-house, where
they locked up their prisoners, Dow was skulking eastward,
and Gavin running down the brae.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re fechting,&#8221; he was told, &#8220;they&#8217;re fechting
on the brae, the sojers is firing, a man&#8217;s killed!&#8221;</p>
<p>But this was an exaggeration.</p>
<p>The brae, though short, is very steep. There is a
hedge on one side of it, from which the land falls away,
and on the other side a hillock. Gavin reached the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
scene to see the soldiers marching down the brae,
guarding a small body of policemen. The armed
weavers were retreating before them. A hundred
women or more were on the hillock, shrieking and
gesticulating. Gavin joined them, calling on them not
to fling the stones they had begun to gather.</p>
<p>The armed men broke into a rabble, flung down their
weapons, and fled back towards the town-house. Here
they almost ran against the soldiers in the square, who
again forced them into the brae. Finding themselves
about to be wedged between the two forces, some
crawled through the hedge, where they were instantly
seized by policemen. Others sought to climb up the
hillock and then escape into the country. The policemen
clambered after them. The men were too frightened
to fight, but a woman seized a policeman by the
waist and flung him head foremost among the soldiers.
One of these shouted &#8220;Fire!&#8221; but the captain cried
&#8220;No.&#8221; Then came showers of missiles from the women.
They stood their ground and defended the retreat of the
scared men.</p>
<p>Who flung the first stone is not known, but it is believed
to have been the Egyptian. The policemen
were recalled, and the whole body ordered to advance
down the brae. Thus the weavers who had not escaped
at once were driven before them, and soon hemmed in
between the two bodies of soldiers, when they were
easily captured. But for two minutes there was a thick
shower of stones and clods of earth.</p>
<p>It was ever afterwards painful to Gavin to recall this
scene, but less on account of the shower of stones than
because of the flight of one divit in it. He had been
watching the handsome young captain, Halliwell, riding
with his men; admiring him, too, for his coolness.
This coolness exasperated the gypsy, who twice flung
at Halliwell and missed him. He rode on smiling
contemptuously.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if I could only fling straight!&#8221; the Egyptian
moaned.</p>
<p>Then she saw the minister by her side, and in the
tick of a clock something happened that can never be
explained. For the moment Gavin was so lost in misery
over the probable effect of the night&#8217;s rioting that
he had forgotten where he was. Suddenly the Egyptian&#8217;s
beautiful face was close to his, and she pressed a
divit into his hand, at the same time pointing at the
officer, and whispering &#8220;Hit him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin flung the clod of earth, and hit Halliwell on
the head.</p>
<p>I say I cannot explain this. I tell what happened,
and add with thankfulness that only the Egyptian witnessed
the deed. Gavin, I suppose, had flung the divit
before he could stay his hand. Then he shrank in
horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Woman!&#8221; he cried again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a dear,&#8221; she said, and vanished.</p>
<p>By the time Gavin was breathing freely again the
lock-up was crammed with prisoners, and the Riot Act
had been read from the town-house stair. It is still
remembered that the baron-bailie, to whom this duty
fell, had got no further than, &#8220;Victoria, by the Grace
of God,&#8221; when the paper was struck out of his hands.</p>
<p>When a stirring event occurs up here we smack our
lips over it for months, and so I could still write a history
of that memorable night in Thrums. I could tell
how the doctor, a man whose shoulders often looked as
if they had been caught in a shower of tobacco ash,
brought me the news to the school-house, and now,
when I crossed the fields to dumfounder Waster Lunny
with it, I found Birse, the post, reeling off the story to
him as fast as a fisher could let out line. I know who
was the first woman on the Marywell brae to hear the
horn, and how she woke her husband, and who heard it
first at the Denhead and the Tenements, with what they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
immediately said and did. I had from Dite Deuchar&#8217;s
own lips the curious story of his sleeping placidly
throughout the whole disturbance, and on wakening in
the morning yoking to his loom as usual; and also his
statement that such ill-luck was enough to shake a
man&#8217;s faith in religion. The police had knowledge
that enabled them to go straight to the houses of the
weavers wanted, but they sometimes brought away the
wrong man, for such of the people as did not escape
from the town had swopped houses for the night&mdash;a
trick that served them better than all their drilling on
the hill. Old Yuill&#8217;s son escaped by burying himself
in a peat-rick, and Snecky Hobart by pretending that
he was a sack of potatoes. Less fortunate was Sanders
Webster, the mole-catcher already mentioned. Sanders
was really an innocent man. He had not even been in
Thrums on the night of the rising against the manufacturers,
but thinking that the outbreak was to be left
unpunished, he wanted his share in the glory of it. So
he had boasted of being a ringleader until many believed
him, including the authorities. His braggadocio
undid him. He was run to earth in a pig-sty,
and got nine months. With the other arrests I need
not concern myself, for they have no part in the story
of the little minister.</p>
<p>While Gavin was with the families whose breadwinners
were now in the lock-up, a cell that was usually
crammed on fair nights and empty for the rest of the
year, the sheriff and Halliwell were in the round-room
of the town-house, not in a good temper. They spoke
loudly, and some of their words sank into the cell
below.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole thing has been a fiasco,&#8221; the sheriff was
heard saying, &#8220;owing to our failing to take them by
surprise. Why, three-fourths of those taken will have
to be liberated, and we have let the worst offenders slip
through our hands.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered Halliwell, who was wearing a
heavy cloak, &#8220;I have brought your policemen into the
place, and that is all I undertook to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You brought them, but at the expense of alarming
the countryside. I wish we had come without you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! My men advanced like ghosts. Could
your police have come down that brae alone to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, because it would have been deserted. Your
soldiers, I tell you, have done the mischief. This
woman, who, so many of our prisoners admit, brought
the news of our coming, must either have got it from
one of your men or have seen them on the march.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The men did not know their destination. True,
she might have seen us despite our precautions, but you
forget that she told them how we were to act in the
event of our being seen. That is what perplexes me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and me too, for it was a close secret between
you and me and Lord Rintoul and not half-a-dozen
others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, find the woman, and we shall get the explanation.
If she is still in the town she cannot escape, for
my men are everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was seen ten minutes ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then she is ours. I say, Riach, if I were you I
would set all my prisoners free and take away a cart-load
of their wives instead. I have only seen the backs
of the men of Thrums, but, on my word, I very nearly
ran away from the women. Hallo! I believe one of
your police has caught our virago single-handed.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Halliwell exclaimed, hearing some one shout,
&#8220;This is the rascal!&#8221; But it was not the Egyptian who
was then thrust into the round-room. It was John
Dunwoodie, looking very sly. Probably there was not,
even in Thrums, a cannier man than Dunwoodie. His
religious views were those of Cruickshanks, but he went
regularly to church &#8220;on the off-chance of there being a
God after all; so I&#8217;m safe, whatever side may be wrong.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>&#8220;This is the man,&#8221; explained a policeman, &#8220;who
brought the alarm. He admits himself having been in
Tilliedrum just before we started.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your name, my man?&#8221; the sheriff demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It micht be John Dunwoodie,&#8221; the tinsmith answered
cautiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;But is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna say it&#8217;s no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were in Tilliedrum this evening?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I micht hae been.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll swear to nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m a canny man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Into the cell with him,&#8221; Halliwell cried, losing
patience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave him to me,&#8221; said the sheriff. &#8220;I understand
the sort of man. Now, Dunwoodie, what were you
doing in Tilliedrum?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was taking my laddie down to be prenticed to a
writer there,&#8221; answered Dunwoodie, falling into the
sheriff&#8217;s net.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I micht be a tinsmith to trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you, a mere tinsmith, dare to tell me that a
lawyer was willing to take your son into his office? Be
cautious, Dunwoodie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, then, the laddie&#8217;s highly edicated and I hae
siller, and that&#8217;s how the writer was to take him and
make a gentleman o&#8217; him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I learn from the neighbours,&#8221; the policeman explained,
&#8220;that this is partly true, but what makes us
suspect him is this. He left the laddie at Tilliedrum,
and yet when he came home the first person he sees at
the fireside is the laddie himself. The laddie had run
home, and the reason plainly was that he had heard of
our preparations and wanted to alarm the town.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There seems something in this, Dunwoodie,&#8221; the
sheriff said, &#8220;and if you cannot explain it I must keep
you in custody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make a clean breast o&#8217;t,&#8221; Dunwoodie replied,
seeing that in this matter truth was best. &#8220;The
laddie was terrible against being made a gentleman,
and when he saw the kind o&#8217; life he would hae to
lead, clean hands, clean dickies, and no gutters on his
breeks, his heart took mair scunner at genteelity than
ever, and he ran hame. Ay, I was mad when I saw
him at the fireside, but he says to me, &#8216;How would you
like to be a gentleman yoursel&#8217;, father?&#8217; he says,
and that so affected me &#8217;at I&#8217;m to gie him his ain
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another prisoner, Dave Langlands, was confronted
with Dunwoodie.</p>
<p>&#8220;John Dunwoodie&#8217;s as innocent as I am mysel,&#8221; Dave
said, &#8220;and I&#8217;m most michty innocent. It wasna John
but the Egyptian that gave the alarm. I tell you what,
sheriff, if it&#8217;ll make me innocenter-like I&#8217;ll picture the
Egyptian to you just as I saw her, and syne you&#8217;ll be
able to catch her easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are an honest fellow,&#8221; said the sheriff.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wish I had the whipping of him,&#8221; growled
Halliwell, who was of a generous nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;For what business had she,&#8221; continued Dave righteously,
&#8220;to meddle in other folks&#8217; business? She&#8217;s no
a Thrums lassie, and so I say, &#8216;Let the law take its
course on her.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you listen to such a cur, Riach?&#8221; asked Halliwell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. Speak out, Langlands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, then, I was in the windmill the nicht.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were a watcher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I happened to be in the windmill wi&#8217; another man,&#8221;
Dave went on, avoiding the officer&#8217;s question.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was his name?&#8221; demanded Halliwell.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It was the Egyptian I was to tell you about,&#8221; Dave
said, looking to the sheriff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, you only tell tales about women,&#8221; said
Halliwell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strange women,&#8221; corrected Dave. &#8220;Weel, we was
there, and it would maybe be twal o&#8217;clock, and we was
speaking (but about lawful things) when we heard some
ane running yont the road. I keeked through a hole in
the door, and I saw it was an Egyptian lassie &#8217;at I had
never clapped een on afore. She saw the licht in the
window, and she cried, &#8216;Hie, you billies in the windmill,
the sojers is coming!&#8217; I fell in a fricht, but the
other man opened the door, and again she cries, &#8216;The
sojers is coming; quick, or you&#8217;ll be ta&#8217;en.&#8217; At that
the other man up wi&#8217; his bonnet and ran, but I didna
make off so smart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had to pick yourself up first,&#8221; suggested the
officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sal, it was the lassie picked me up; ay, and she
picked up a horn at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Blaw on that,&#8217; she cried, &#8216;and alarm the town.&#8217;
But, sheriff, I didna do&#8217;t. Na, I had ower muckle respect
for the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In other words,&#8221; said Halliwell, &#8220;you also bolted,
and left the gypsy to blow the horn herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna deny but what I made my feet my friend,
but it wasna her that blew the horn. I ken that, for I
looked back and saw her trying to do&#8217;t, but she couldna,
she didna ken the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then who did blow it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The first man she met, I suppose. We a&#8217; kent that
the horn was to be the signal except Wearywarld. He&#8217;s
police, so we kept it frae him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is all you saw of the woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, for I ran straucht to my garret, and there your
men took me. Can I gae hame now, sheriff?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you cannot. Describe the woman&#8217;s appearance.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She had a heap o&#8217; rowan berries stuck in her hair,
and, I think, she had on a green wrapper and a red
shawl. She had a most extraordinary face. I canna
exact describe it, for she would be lauchin&#8217; one second
and syne solemn the next. I tell you her face changed
as quick as you could turn the pages o&#8217; a book. Ay,
here comes Wearywarld to speak up for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wearyworld entered cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the local policeman,&#8221; a Tilliedrum officer
said; &#8220;we have been searching for him everywhere,
and only found him now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; asked the sheriff, wrathfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whaur maist honest men is at this hour,&#8221; replied
Wearyworld; &#8220;in my bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How dared you ignore your duty at such a time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long story,&#8221; the policeman answered, pleasantly,
in anticipation of a talk at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Answer me in a word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a word!&#8221; cried the policeman, quite crestfallen.
&#8220;It canna be done. You&#8217;ll need to cross-examine me,
too. It&#8217;s my lawful richt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you to the Tilliedrum gaol for your share
in this night&#8217;s work if you do not speak to the purpose.
Why did you not hasten to our assistance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As sure as death I never kent you was here. I was
up the Roods on my rounds when I heard an awfu&#8217; din
down in the square, and thinks I, there&#8217;s rough characters
about, and the place for honest folk is their bed.
So to my bed I gaed, and I was in&#8217;t when your men
gripped me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must see into this before we leave. In the
meantime you will act as a guide to my searchers.
Stop! Do you know anything of this Egyptian?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What Egyptian? Is&#8217;t a lassie wi&#8217; rowans in her
hair?&#8221;</p>

THE EGYPTIAN.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;The same. Have you seen her?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That I have. There&#8217;s nothing agin her, is there?
Whatever it is, I&#8217;ll uphaud she didna do&#8217;t, for a simpler,
franker-spoken crittur couldna be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind what I want her for. When did you
see her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be about twal o&#8217;clock,&#8221; began Wearyworld
unctuously, &#8220;when I was in the Roods, ay, no lang
afore I heard the disturbance in the square. I was
standing in the middle o&#8217; the road, wondering how the
door o&#8217; the windmill was swinging open, when she
came up to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;A fine nicht for the time o&#8217; year,&#8217; I says to her, for
nobody but the minister had spoken to me a&#8217; day.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;A very fine nicht,&#8217; says she, very frank, though she
was breathing quick like as if she had been running.
&#8216;You&#8217;ll be police?&#8217; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am,&#8217; says I, &#8216;and wha be you?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m just a puir gypsy lassie,&#8217; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And what&#8217;s that in your hand?&#8217; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s a horn I found in the wood,&#8217; says she, &#8216;but it&#8217;s
rusty and winna blaw.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I laughed at her ignorance, and says I, &#8216;I warrant I
could blaw it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I dinna believe you,&#8217; says she.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Gie me haud o&#8217;t,&#8217; says I, and she gae it to me, and I
blew some bonny blasts on&#8217;t. Ay, you see she didna ken
the way o&#8217;t. &#8216;Thank you kindly,&#8217; says she, and she ran
awa without even minding to take the horn back again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You incredible idiot!&#8221; cried the sheriff. &#8220;Then it
was you who gave the alarm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What hae I done to madden you?&#8221; honest Wearyworld
asked in perplexity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out of my sight, sir!&#8221; roared the sheriff.</p>
<p>But the captain laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like your doughty policeman, Riach,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Hie, obliging friend, let us hear how this gypsy struck
you. How was she dressed?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She was snod, but no unca snod,&#8221; replied Wearyworld,
stiffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean she was couthie, but no sair in order.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, a tasty stocky, but gey orra put on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What language are you speaking, you enigma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m saying she was naturally a bonny bit kimmer
rather than happit up to the nines.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, go away,&#8221; cried Halliwell; whereupon Wearyworld
descended the stair haughtily, declaring that the
sheriff was an unreasonable man, and that he was a
queer captain who did not understand the English
language.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I gae hame now, sheriff?&#8221; asked Langlands,
hopefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take this fellow back to his cell,&#8221; Riach directed
shortly, &#8220;and whatever else you do, see that you capture
this woman. Halliwell, I am going out to look
for her myself. Confound it, what are you laughing
at?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the way this vixen has slipped through your
fingers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite that, sir, not quite that. She is in
Thrums still, and I swear I&#8217;ll have her before day
breaks. See to it, Halliwell, that if she is brought
here in my absence she does not slip through your
fingers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she is brought here,&#8221; said Halliwell, mocking
him, &#8220;you must return and protect me. It would be
cruelty to leave a poor soldier in the hands of a woman
of Thrums.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is not a Thrums woman. You have been told
so a dozen times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I am not afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the round-room (which is oblong) there is a throne
on which the bailie sits when he dispenses justice. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
is swathed in red cloths that give it the appearance of a
pulpit. Left to himself, Halliwell flung off his cloak
and taking a chair near this dais rested his legs on the
bare wooden table, one on each side of the lamp. He
was still in this position when the door opened, and two
policemen thrust the Egyptian into the room.</p>

<h2>Chapter Seven.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />HAS THE FOLLY OF LOOKING INTO A WOMAN&#8217;S EYES BY WAY OF TEXT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;This is the woman, captain,&#8221; one of the policemen
said in triumph; &#8220;and, begging your pardon, will you
keep a grip of her till the sheriff comes back?&#8221;</p>
<p>Halliwell did not turn his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can leave her here,&#8221; he said carelessly.
&#8220;Three of us are not needed to guard a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s a slippery customer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can go,&#8221; said Halliwell; and the policemen
withdrew slowly, eyeing their prisoner doubtfully until
the door closed. Then the officer wheeled round languidly,
expecting to find the Egyptian gaunt and
muscular.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;why&mdash;&mdash;By Jove!&#8221;</p>
<p>The gallant soldier was as much taken aback as if he
had turned to find a pistol at his ear. He took his feet
off the table. Yet he only saw the gypsy&#8217;s girlish figure
in its red and green, for she had covered her face
with her hands. She was looking at him intently between
her fingers, but he did not know this. All he
did want to know just then was what was behind the
hands.</p>
<p>Before he spoke again she had perhaps made up her
mind about him, for she began to sob bitterly. At the
same time she slipped a finger over her ring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you look at me?&#8221; asked Halliwell,
selfishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I daurna.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Am I so fearsome?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a sojer, and you would shoot me like a
craw.&#8221;</p>
<p>Halliwell laughed, and taking her wrists in his hands,
uncovered her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, by Jove!&#8221; he said again, but this time to
himself.</p>
<p>As for the Egyptian, she slid the ring into her pocket,
and fell back before the officer&#8217;s magnificence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;is all sojers like you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was such admiration in her eyes that it would
have been self-contempt to doubt her. Yet having
smiled complacently, Halliwell became uneasy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who on earth are you?&#8221; he asked, finding it wise
not to look her in the face. &#8220;Why do you not answer
me more quickly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinna be angry at that, captain,&#8221; the Egyptian implored.
&#8220;I promised my mither aye to count twenty
afore I spoke, because she thocht I was ower glib.
Captain, how is&#8217;t that you&#8217;re so fleid to look at me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus put on his mettle, Halliwell again faced her,
with the result that his question changed to &#8220;Where
did you get those eyes?&#8221; Then was he indignant with
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I want to know,&#8221; he explained severely, &#8220;is
how you were able to acquaint the Thrums people with
our movements? That you must tell me at once, for
the sheriff blames my soldiers. Come now, no counting
twenty!&#8221;</p>
<p>He was pacing the room now, and she had her face
to herself. It said several things, among them that the
officer evidently did not like this charge against his
men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does the shirra blame the sojers?&#8221; exclaimed this
quick-witted Egyptian. &#8220;Weel, that cows, for he has
nane to blame but himsel&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Halliwell, delighted. &#8220;It was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
sheriff who told tales? Answer me. You are counting
a hundred this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps the gypsy had two reasons for withholding
her answer. If so, one of them was that as the sheriff
had told nothing, she had a story to make up. The
other was that she wanted to strike a bargain with the
officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I tell you,&#8221; she said eagerly, &#8220;will you set me
free?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I may ask the sheriff to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he mauna see me,&#8221; the Egyptian said in distress.
&#8220;There&#8217;s reasons, captain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, surely you have not been before him on other
occasions,&#8221; said Halliwell, surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;No in the way you mean,&#8221; muttered the gypsy, and
for the moment her eyes twinkled. But the light in
them went out when she remembered that the sheriff
was near, and she looked desperately at the window as
if ready to fling herself from it. She had very good
reasons for not wishing to be seen by Riach, though
fear that he would put her in gaol was not one of them.</p>
<p>Halliwell thought it was the one cause of her woe,
and great was his desire to turn the tables on the sheriff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me the truth,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I promise to befriend
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, then,&#8221; the gypsy said, hoping still to soften
his heart, and making up her story as she told it, &#8220;yestreen
I met the shirra, and he telled me a&#8217; I hae telled
the Thrums folk this nicht.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can scarcely expect me to believe that. Where
did you meet him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Glen Quharity. He was riding on a horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I allow he was there yesterday, and on horseback.
He was on his way back to Tilliedrum from
Lord Rintoul&#8217;s place. But don&#8217;t tell me that he took
a gypsy girl into his confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, he did, without kenning. He was gieing his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
horse a drink when I met him, and he let me tell him
his fortune. He said he would gaol me for an impostor
if I didna tell him true, so I gaed about it cautiously,
and after a minute or twa I telled him he was coming
to Thrums the nicht to nab the rioters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are trifling with me,&#8221; interposed the indignant
soldier. &#8220;You promised to tell me not what you said to
the sheriff, but how he disclosed our movements to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s just what I am telling you, only you
hinna the rumelgumption to see it. How do you think
fortunes is telled? First we get out o&#8217; the man, without
his seeing what we&#8217;re after, a&#8217; about himsel&#8217;, and
syne we repeat it to him. That&#8217;s what I did wi&#8217; the
shirra.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You drew the whole thing out of him without his
knowing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Deed I did, and he rode awa&#8217; saying I was a witch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The soldier heard with the delight of a schoolboy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now if the sheriff does not liberate you at my request,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;I will never let him hear the end of
this story. He was right; you are a witch. You deceived
the sheriff; yes, undoubtedly you are a witch.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her with fun in his face, but the fun
disappeared, and a wondering admiration took its place.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder you bewitched
the sheriff. I must take care or you will bewitch the
captain, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this notion he smiled, but he also ceased looking
at her. Suddenly the Egyptian again began to cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re angry wi&#8217; me,&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;I wish I had
never set een on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you wish that?&#8221; Halliwell asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine you ken,&#8221; she answered, and again covered her
face with her hands.</p>
<p>He looked at her undecidedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not angry with you,&#8221; he said, gently. &#8220;You
are an extraordinary girl.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>Had he really made a conquest of this beautiful creature?
Her words said so, but had he? The captain
could not make up his mind. He gnawed his moustache
in doubt.</p>
<p>There was silence, save for the Egyptian&#8217;s sobs.
Halliwell&#8217;s heart was touched, and he drew nearer her.</p>
<p>&#8220;My poor girl&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped. Was she crying? Was she not laughing
at him rather? He became red.</p>
<p>The gypsy peeped at him between her fingers, and
saw that he was of two minds. She let her hands fall
from her face, and undoubtedly there were tears on her
cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re no angry wi&#8217; me,&#8221; she said, sadly, &#8220;how
will you no look at me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am looking at you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was very close to her, and staring into her wonderful
eyes. I am older than the Captain, and those
eyes have dazzled me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put her hand in his. His chest rose. He knew
she was seeking to beguile him, but he could not take
his eyes off hers. He was in a worse plight than a
woman listening to the first whisper of love.</p>
<p>Now she was further from him, but the spell held.
She reached the door, without taking her eyes from his
face. For several seconds he had been as a man mesmerised.</p>
<p>Just in time he came to. It was when she turned
from him to find the handle of the door. She was turning
it when his hand fell on hers so suddenly that she
screamed. He twisted her round.</p>

CAPTAIN HALLIWELL.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Sit down there,&#8221; he said hoarsely, pointing to the
chair upon which he had flung his cloak. She dared
not disobey. Then he leant against the door, his back
to her, for just then he wanted no one to see his face.
The gypsy sat very still and a little frightened.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>Halliwell opened the door presently, and called to
the soldier on duty below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Davidson, see if you can find the sheriff. I want
him. And Davidson&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he muttered, and the old soldier marvelled at
his words, &#8220;it is better. Davidson, lock this door on
the outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davidson did as he was ordered, and again the Egyptian
was left alone with Halliwell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid of a woman!&#8221; she said, contemptuously,
though her heart sank when she heard the key turn in
the lock.</p>
<p>&#8220;I admit it,&#8221; he answered, calmly.</p>
<p>He walked up and down the room, and she sat silently
watching him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That story of yours about the sheriff was not true,&#8221;
he said at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suspect it wasna,&#8221; answered the Egyptian coolly.
&#8220;Hae you been thinking about it a&#8217; this time? Captain,
I could tell you what you&#8217;re thinking now. You&#8217;re
wishing it had been true, so that the ane o&#8217; you couldna
lauch at the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; said the captain, and not another word
would he speak until he heard the sheriff coming up
the stair. The Egyptian trembled at his step, and rose
in desperation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is the door locked?&#8221; cried the sheriff, shaking
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; answered Halliwell; &#8220;the key is on your
side.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment the Egyptian knocked the lamp off
the table, and the room was at once in darkness. The
officer sprang at her, and, catching her by the skirt,
held on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you in darkness?&#8221; asked the sheriff, as he
entered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Shut the door,&#8221; cried Halliwell. &#8220;Put your back
to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me the woman has escaped?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have her, I have her! She capsized the lamp, the
little jade. Shut the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still keeping firm hold of her, as he thought, the
captain relit the lamp with his other hand. It showed
an extraordinary scene. The door was shut, and the
sheriff was guarding it. Halliwell was clutching the
cloth of the bailie&#8217;s seat. There was no Egyptian.</p>
<p>A moment passed before either man found his tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open the door. After her!&#8221; cried Halliwell.</p>
<p>But the door would not open. The Egyptian had fled
and locked it behind her.</p>
<p>What the two men said to each other, it would not be
fitting to tell. When Davidson, who had been gossiping
at the corner of the town-house, released his captain
and the sheriff, the gypsy had been gone for some
minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she shan&#8217;t escape us,&#8221; Riach cried, and hastened
out to assist in the pursuit.</p>
<p>Halliwell was in such a furious temper that he called
up Davidson and admonished him for neglect of duty.</p>

<h2>Chapter Eight.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />3 A.M.&mdash;MONSTROUS AUDACITY OF THE WOMAN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Not till the stroke of three did Gavin turn homeward,
with the legs of a ploughman, and eyes rebelling against
over-work. Seeking to comfort his dejected people,
whose courage lay spilt on the brae, he had been in as
many houses as the policemen. The soldiers marching
through the wynds came frequently upon him, and
found it hard to believe that he was always the same
one. They told afterwards that Thrums was remarkable
for the ferocity of its women, and the number of
its little ministers. The morning was nipping cold,
and the streets were deserted, for the people had been
ordered within doors. As he crossed the Roods, Gavin
saw a gleam of red-coats. In the back wynd he heard
a bugle blown. A stir in the Banker&#8217;s close spoke of
another seizure. At the top of the school wynd two
policeman, of whom one was Wearyworld, stopped the
minister with the flash of a lantern.</p>
<p>&#8220;We dauredna let you pass, sir,&#8221; the Tilliedrum man
said, &#8220;without a good look at you. That&#8217;s the orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hereby swear,&#8221; said Wearyworld, authoritatively,
&#8220;that this is no the Egyptian. Signed, Peter Spens,
policeman, called by the vulgar, Wearyworld. Mr.
Dishart, you can pass, unless you&#8217;ll bide a wee and gie
us your crack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not found the gypsy, then?&#8221; Gavin asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the other policeman said, &#8220;but we ken she&#8217;s
within cry o&#8217; this very spot, and escape she canna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What mortal man can do,&#8221; Wearyworld said, &#8220;we&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
doing: ay, and mair, but she&#8217;s auld wecht, and may
find bilbie in queer places. Mr. Dishart, my official
opinion is that this Egyptian is fearsomely like my
snuff-spoon. I&#8217;ve kent me drap that spoon on the fender,
and be beat to find it in an hour. And yet, a&#8217; the
time I was sure it was there. This is a gey mysterious
world, and women&#8217;s the uncanniest things in&#8217;t. It&#8217;s
hardly mous to think how uncanny they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This one deserves to be punished,&#8221; Gavin said,
firmly; &#8220;she incited the people to riot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did,&#8221; agreed Wearyworld, who was supping
ravenously on sociability; &#8220;ay, she even tried her tricks
on me, so that them that kens no better thinks she
fooled me. But she&#8217;s cracky. To gie her her due,
she&#8217;s cracky, and as for her being a cuttie, you&#8217;ve said
yoursel, Mr. Dishart, that we&#8217;re all desperately wicked.
But we&#8217;re sair tried. Has it ever struck you that the
trouts bites best on the Sabbath? God&#8217;s critturs tempting
decent men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come alang,&#8221; cried the Tilliedrum man, impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming, but I maun give Mr. Dishart permission
to pass first. Hae you heard, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; Wearyworld
whispered, &#8220;that the Egyptian diddled baith the
captain and the shirra? It&#8217;s my official opinion that
she&#8217;s no better than a roasted onion, the which, if you
grip it firm, jumps out o&#8217; sicht, leaving its coat in
your fingers. Mr. Dishart, you can pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>The policeman turned down the school wynd, and
Gavin, who had already heard exaggerated accounts of
the strange woman&#8217;s escape from the town-house, proceeded
along the Tenements. He walked in the black
shadows of the houses, though across the way there was
the morning light.</p>
<p>In talking of the gypsy, the little minister had, as it
were, put on the black cap; but now, even though he
shook his head angrily with every thought of her, the
scene in Windyghoul glimmered before his eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
Sometimes when he meant to frown he only sighed,
and then having sighed he shook himself. He was
unpleasantly conscious of his right hand, which had
flung the divit. Ah, she was shameless, and it would
be a bright day for Thrums that saw the last of her.
He hoped the policemen would succeed in&mdash;&mdash;. It was
the gladsomeness of innocence that he had seen dancing
in the moonlight. A mere woman could not be like
that. How soft&mdash;&mdash;. And she had derided him; he,
the Auld Licht minister of Thrums, had been flouted
before his people by a hussy. She was without reverence,
she knew no difference between an Auld Licht
minister, whose duty it was to speak and hers to listen,
and herself. This woman deserved to be&mdash;&mdash;. And
the look she cast behind her as she danced and sang!
It was sweet, so wistful; the presence of purity had
silenced him. Purity! Who had made him fling that
divit? He would think no more of her. Let it suffice
that he knew what she was. He would put her from
his thoughts. Was it a ring on her finger?</p>
<p>Fifty yards in front of him Gavin saw the road end in
a wall of soldiers. They were between him and the
manse, and he was still in darkness. No sound reached
him, save the echo of his own feet. But was it an echo?
He stopped, and turned round sharply. Now he heard
nothing, he saw nothing. Yet was not that a human
figure standing motionless in the shadow behind?</p>
<p>He walked on, and again heard the sound. Again he
looked behind, but this time without stopping. The
figure was following him. He stopped. So did it.
He turned back, but it did not move. It was the
Egyptian!</p>
<p>Gavin knew her, despite the lane of darkness, despite
the long cloak that now concealed even her feet, despite
the hood over her head. She was looking quite respectable,
but he knew her.</p>
<p>He neither advanced to her nor retreated. Could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
the unhappy girl not see that she was walking into the
arms of the soldiers? But doubtless she had been driven
from all her hiding-places. For a moment Gavin had
it in his heart to warn her. But it was only for a
moment. The next a sudden horror shot through him.
She was stealing toward him, so softly that he had not
seen her start. The woman had designs on him!
Gavin turned from her. He walked so quickly that
judges would have said he ran.</p>
<p>The soldiers, I have said, stood in the dim light.
Gavin had almost reached them, when a little hand
touched his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop,&#8221; cried the sergeant, hearing some one approaching,
and then Gavin stepped out of the darkness
with the gypsy on his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is you, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; said the sergeant, &#8220;and
your lady?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;&mdash;,&#8221; said Gavin.</p>
<p>His lady pinched his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, in an elegant English voice
that made Gavin stare at her, &#8220;but, indeed, I am sorry
I ventured into the streets to-night. I thought I might
be able to comfort some of these unhappy people, captain,
but I could do little, sadly little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no scene for a lady, ma&#8217;am, but your husband
has&mdash;&mdash;. Did you speak, Mr. Dishart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I must inf&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; said the Egyptian, &#8220;I quite agree with
you, so we need not detain the captain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only a sergeant, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; said the Egyptian, raising her pretty eyebrows,
&#8220;and how long are you to remain in Thrums,
sergeant?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only for a few hours, Mrs. Dishart. If this gypsy
lassie had not given us so much trouble, we might have
been gone by now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, I hope you will catch her, sergeant.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Sergeant,&#8221; said Gavin, firmly, &#8220;I must&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must, indeed, dear,&#8221; said the Egyptian, &#8220;for
you are sadly tired. Good-night, sergeant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your servant, Mrs. Dishart. Your servant, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;,&#8221; cried Gavin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, love,&#8221; said the Egyptian, and she walked the
distracted minister through the soldiers and up the
manse road.</p>
<p>The soldiers left behind, Gavin flung her arm from
him, and, standing still, shook his fist in her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you&mdash;woman!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This, I think, was the last time he called her a woman.</p>
<p>But she was clapping her hands merrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was beautiful!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was iniquitous!&#8221; he answered. &#8220;And I a
minister!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t help that,&#8221; said the Egyptian, who pitied
all ministers heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Gavin said, misunderstanding her, &#8220;I could
not help it. No blame attaches to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I meant that you could not help being a minister.
You could have helped saving me, and I thank you so
much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not dare to thank me. I forbid you to say that
I saved you. I did my best to hand you over to the
authorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why did you not hand me over?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin groaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;All you had to say,&#8221; continued the merciless Egyptian,
&#8220;was, &#8216;This is the person you are in search of.&#8217; I
did not have my hand over your mouth. Why did you
not say it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forbear!&#8221; said Gavin, woefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been,&#8221; the gypsy said, &#8220;because you
really wanted to help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it was against my better judgment,&#8221; said
Gavin.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I am glad of that,&#8221; said the gypsy. &#8220;Mr. Dishart,
I do believe you like me all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can a man like a woman against his will?&#8221; Gavin
blurted out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he can,&#8221; said the Egyptian, speaking as
one who knew. &#8220;That is the very nicest way to be liked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing how agitated Gavin was, remorse filled her,
and she said in a wheedling voice&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all over, and no one will know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Passion sat on the minister&#8217;s brow, but he said nothing,
for the gypsy&#8217;s face had changed with her voice,
and the audacious woman was become a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sorry,&#8221; she said, as if he had caught her
stealing jam. The hood had fallen back, and she looked
pleadingly at him. She had the appearance of one who
was entirely in his hands.</p>
<p>There was a torrent of words in Gavin, but only these
trickled forth&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not angry any more?&#8221; pleaded the Egyptian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angry!&#8221; he cried, with the righteous rage of one
who when his leg is being sawn off is asked gently if it
hurts him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you are,&#8221; she sighed, and the sigh meant
that men are strange.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you no respect for law and order?&#8221; demanded
Gavin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; she answered, honestly.</p>
<p>He looked down the road to where the red-coats were
still visible, and his face became hard. She read his
thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, becoming a woman again, &#8220;It is not
yet too late. Why don&#8217;t you shout to them?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was holding herself like a queen, but there was
no stiffness in her. They might have been a pair of
lovers, and she the wronged one. Again she looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
timidly at him, and became beautiful in a new way.
Her eyes said that he was very cruel, and she was only
keeping back her tears till he had gone. More dangerous
than her face was her manner, which gave Gavin
the privilege of making her unhappy; it permitted him
to argue with her; it never implied that though he
raged at her he must stand afar off; it called him a
bully, but did not end the conversation.</p>
<p>Now (but perhaps I should not tell this) unless she is
his wife a man is shot with a thrill of exultation every
time a pretty woman allows him to upbraid her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not understand you,&#8221; Gavin repeated weakly,
and the gypsy bent her head under this terrible charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a few hours ago,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;you were a
gypsy girl in a fantastic dress, barefooted&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Egyptian&#8217;s bare foot at once peeped out mischievously
from beneath the cloak, then again retired
into hiding.</p>
<p>&#8220;You spoke as broadly,&#8221; complained the minister,
somewhat taken aback by this apparition, &#8220;as any
woman in Thrums, and now you fling a cloak over your
shoulders, and immediately become a fine lady. Who
are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; answered the Egyptian, &#8220;it is the cloak
that has bewitched me.&#8221; She slipped out of it. &#8220;Ay,
ay, ou losh!&#8221; she said, as if surprised, &#8220;it was just the
cloak that did it, for now I&#8217;m a puir ignorant bit lassie
again. My, certie, but claithes does make a differ to a
woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was sheer levity, and Gavin walked scornfully
away from it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet, if you will not tell me who you are,&#8221; he said,
looking over his shoulder, &#8220;tell me where you got the
cloak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na faags,&#8221; replied the gypsy out of the cloak.
&#8220;Really, Mr. Dishart, you had better not ask,&#8221; she
added, replacing it over her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>She followed him, meaning to gain the open by the
fields to the north of the manse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; she said, holding out her hand, &#8220;if you
are not to give me up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not a policeman,&#8221; replied Gavin, but he would
not take her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely, we part friends, then?&#8221; said the Egyptian,
sweetly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Gavin answered. &#8220;I hope never to see your
face again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot help,&#8221; the Egyptian said, with dignity,
&#8220;your not liking my face.&#8221; Then, with less dignity,
she added, &#8220;There is a splotch of mud on your own, little
minister; it came off the divit you flung at the
captain.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this parting shot she tripped past him, and
Gavin would not let his eyes follow her. It was not
the mud on his face that distressed him, nor even the
hand that had flung the divit. It was the word &#8220;little.&#8221;
Though even Margaret was not aware of it, Gavin&#8217;s
shortness had grieved him all his life. There had been
times when he tried to keep the secret from himself.
In his boyhood he had sought a remedy by getting his
larger comrades to stretch him. In the company of tall
men he was always self-conscious. In the pulpit he
looked darkly at his congregation when he asked them
who, by taking thought, could add a cubit to his stature.
When standing on a hearthrug his heels were frequently
on the fender. In his bedroom he has stood on a footstool
and surveyed himself in the mirror. Once he
fastened high heels to his boots, being ashamed to ask
Hendry Munn to do it for him; but this dishonesty
shamed him, and he tore them off. So the Egyptian
had put a needle into his pride, and he walked to the
manse gloomily.</p>

</div>
<p>Margaret was at her window, looking for him, and he
saw her though she did not see him. He was stepping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
into the middle of the road to wave his hand to her,
when some sudden weakness made him look towards
the fields instead. The Egyptian saw him and nodded
thanks for his interest in her, but he scowled and pretended
to be studying the sky. Next moment he saw
her running back to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are soldiers at the top of the field,&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;I cannot escape that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no other way,&#8221; Gavin answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you not help me again?&#8221; she entreated.</p>
<p>She should not have said &#8220;again.&#8221; Gavin shook his
head, but pulled her closer to the manse dyke, for his
mother was still in sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you do that?&#8221; the girl asked, quickly, looking
round to see if she were pursued. &#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; she
said, as her eyes fell on the figure at the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my mother,&#8221; Gavin said, though he need not
have explained, unless he wanted the gypsy to know
that he was a bachelor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only your mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only! Let me tell you she may suffer more than
you for your behaviour to-night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are caught, will it not be discovered that I
helped you to escape?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you said you did not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I helped you,&#8221; Gavin admitted. &#8220;My God!
what would my congregation say if they knew I had let
you pass yourself off as&mdash;as my wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>He struck his brow, and the Egyptian had the propriety
to blush.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not the punishment from men I am afraid of,&#8221;
Gavin said, bitterly, &#8220;but from my conscience. No,
that is not true. I do fear exposure, but for my
mother&#8217;s sake. Look at her; she is happy, because
she thinks me good and true; she has had such trials
as you cannot know of, and now, when at last I seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
able to do something for her, you destroy her happiness.
You have her life in your hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Egyptian turned her back upon him, and one of
her feet tapped angrily on the dry ground. Then,
child of impulse as she always was, she flashed an indignant
glance at him, and walked quickly down the
road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;To give myself up. You need not be alarmed; I
will clear you.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was not a shake in her voice, and she spoke
without looking back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; Gavin called, but she would not, until his
hand touched her shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;&#8221; whispered Gavin, giddily, &#8220;why&mdash;why do
you not hide in the manse garden?&mdash;No one will look
for you there.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were genuine tears in the gypsy&#8217;s eyes now.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a good man,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that,&#8221; Gavin cried in horror. &#8220;There is
a summer-seat in the garden.&#8221;</p>

see if she took his advice, hastened to the manse. Once
inside, he snibbed the door.</p>

<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />THE WOMAN CONSIDERED IN ABSENCE&mdash;ADVENTURES OF A MILITARY CLOAK.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>About six o&#8217;clock Margaret sat up suddenly in bed,
with the conviction that she had slept in. To her this
was to ravel the day: a dire thing. The last time it
happened Gavin, softened by her distress, had condensed
morning worship into a sentence that she might make
up on the clock.</p>
<p>Her part on waking was merely to ring her bell, and
so rouse Jean, for Margaret had given Gavin a promise
to breakfast in bed, and remain there till her fire was
lit. Accustomed all her life, however, to early rising,
her feet were usually on the floor before she remembered
her vow, and then it was but a step to the window
to survey the morning. To Margaret, who seldom
went out, the weather was not of great moment, while
it mattered much to Gavin, yet she always thought of
it the first thing, and he not at all until he had to decide
whether his companion should be an umbrella or a
staff.</p>
<p>On this morning Margaret only noticed that there
had been rain since Gavin came in. Forgetting that
the water obscuring the outlook was on the other side
of the panes, she tried to brush it away with her fist.
It was of the soldiers she was thinking. They might
have been awaiting her appearance at the window as
their signal to depart, for hardly had she raised the
blind when they began their march out of Thrums.
From the manse she could not see them, but she heard
them, and she saw some people at the Tenements run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
to their houses at sound of the drum. Other persons,
less timid, followed the enemy with execrations halfway
to Tilliedrum. Margaret, the only person, as it
happened, then awake in the manse, stood listening for
some time. In the summer-seat of the garden, however,
there was another listener protected from her
sight by thin spars.</p>
<p>Despite the lateness of the hour Margaret was too
soft-hearted to rouse Jean, who had lain down in her
clothes, trembling for her father. She went instead
into Gavin&#8217;s room to look admiringly at him as he slept.
Often Gavin woke to find that his mother had slipped
in to save him the enormous trouble of opening a drawer
for a clean collar, or of pouring the water into the basin
with his own hand. Sometimes he caught her in the
act of putting thick socks in the place of thin ones, and
it must be admitted that her passion for keeping his
belongings in boxes, and the boxes in secret places, and
the secret places at the back of drawers, occasionally
led to their being lost when wanted. &#8220;They are safe,
at any rate, for I put them away some gait,&#8221; was then
Margaret&#8217;s comfort, but less soothing to Gavin. Yet if
he upbraided her in his hurry, it was to repent bitterly his
temper the next instant, and to feel its effects more than
she, temper being a weapon that we hold by the blade.
When he awoke and saw her in his room he would pretend,
unless he felt called upon to rage at her for self-neglect,
to be still asleep, and then be filled with
tenderness for her. A great writer has spoken sadly of
the shock it would be to a mother to know her boy as
he really is, but I think she often knows him better
than he is known to cynical friends. We should be
slower to think that the man at his worst is the real
man, and certain that the better we are ourselves the
less likely is he to be at his worst in our company.
Every time he talks away his own character before us
he is signifying contempt for ours.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>On this morning Margaret only opened Gavin&#8217;s door
to stand and look, for she was fearful of awakening him
after his heavy night. Even before she saw that he
still slept she noticed with surprise that, for the first
time since he came to Thrums, he had put on his shutters.
She concluded that he had done this lest the light
should rouse him. He was not sleeping pleasantly, for
now he put his open hand before his face, as if to guard
himself, and again he frowned and seemed to draw back
from something. He pointed his finger sternly to the
north, ordering the weavers, his mother thought, to return
to their homes, and then he muttered to himself so
that she heard the words, &#8220;And if thy right hand offend
thee cut it off, and cast it from thee, for it is profitable
for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not
that thy whole body should be cast into hell.&#8221; Then
suddenly he bent forward, his eyes open and fixed on
the window. Thus he sat, for the space of half a minute,
like one listening with painful intentness. When
he lay back Margaret slipped away. She knew he was
living the night over again, but not of the divit his
right hand had cast, nor of the woman in the garden.</p>
<p>Gavin was roused presently by the sound of voices
from Margaret&#8217;s room, where Jean, who had now gathered
much news, was giving it to her mistress. Jean&#8217;s
cheerfulness would have told him that her father was
safe had he not wakened to thoughts of the Egyptian.
I suppose he was at the window in an instant, unsnibbing
the shutters and looking out as cautiously as a
burglar might have looked in. The Egyptian was gone
from the summer-seat. He drew a great breath.</p>
<p>But his troubles were not over. He had just lifted
his ewer of water when these words from the kitchen
capsized it:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, an Egyptian. That&#8217;s what the auld folk call a
gypsy. Weel, Mrs. Dishart, she led police and sojers
sic a dance through Thrums as would baffle description,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
though I kent the fits and fors o&#8217;t as I dinna. Ay, but
they gripped her in the end, and the queer thing is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin listened to no more. He suddenly sat down.
The queer thing, of course, was that she had been
caught in his garden. Yes, and doubtless queerer
things about this hussy and her &#8220;husband&#8221; were being
bawled from door to door. To the girl&#8217;s probable
sufferings he gave no heed. What kind of man had he
been a few hours ago to yield to the machinations of
a woman who was so obviously the devil? Now he saw
his folly in the face.</p>
<p>The tray in Jean&#8217;s hands clattered against the dresser,
and Gavin sprang from his chair. He thought it was
his elders at the front door.</p>
<p>In the parlour he found Margaret sorrowing for those
whose mates had been torn from them, and Jean with a
face flushed by talk. On ordinary occasions the majesty
of the minister still cowed Jean, so that she could only
gaze at him without shaking when in church, and then
because she wore a veil. In the manse he was for taking
a glance at sideways and then going away comforted,
as a respectable woman may once or twice in a
day look at her brooch in the pasteboard box as a means
of helping her with her work. But with such a to-do
in Thrums, and she the possessor of exclusive information,
Jean&#8217;s reverence for Gavin only took her to-day
as far as the door, where she lingered half in the parlour
and half in the lobby, her eyes turned politely
from the minister, but her ears his entirely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I heard Jean telling you about the capture
of the&mdash;of an Egyptian woman,&#8221; Gavin said to his
mother, nervously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you cry to me?&#8221; Jean asked, turning round
longingly. &#8220;But maybe the mistress will tell you about
the Egyptian hersel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has she been taken to Tilliedrum?&#8221; Gavin asked in
a hollow voice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Sup up your porridge, Gavin,&#8221; Margaret said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
have no speaking about this terrible night till you&#8217;ve
eaten something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no appetite,&#8221; the minister replied, pushing
his plate from him. &#8220;Jean, answer me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Deed, then,&#8221; said Jean willingly, &#8220;they hinna ta&#8217;en
her to Tilliedrum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For what reason?&#8221; asked Gavin, his dread increasing.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the reason that they couldna catch her,&#8221; Jean
answered. &#8220;She spirited hersel awa&#8217;, the magerful
crittur.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! But I heard you say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, they had her aince, but they couldna keep her.
It&#8217;s like a witch story. They had her safe in the town-house,
and baith shirra and captain guarding her, and
syne in a clink she wasna there. A&#8217; nicht they looked
for her, but she hadna left so muckle as a foot-print
ahint her, and in the tail of the day they had to up wi&#8217;
their tap in their lap and march awa without her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin&#8217;s appetite returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has she been seen since the soldiers went away?&#8221;
he asked, laying down his spoon with a new fear.
&#8220;Where is she now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No human eye has seen her,&#8221; Jean answered impressively.
&#8220;Whaur is she now? Whaur does the flies
vanish to in winter? We ken they&#8217;re some gait, but
whaur?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what are the people saying about her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daft things,&#8221; said Jean. &#8220;Old Charles Yuill gangs
the length o&#8217; hinting that she&#8217;s dead and buried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She could not have buried herself, Jean,&#8221; Margaret
said, mildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna ken. Charles says she&#8217;s even capable o&#8217;
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Jean retired reluctantly (but leaving the door
ajar) and Gavin fell to on his porridge. He was now
so cheerful that Margaret wondered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If half the stories about this gypsy be true,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;she must be more than a mere woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Less, you mean, mother,&#8221; Gavin said, with conviction.
&#8220;She is a woman, and a sinful one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see her, Gavin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw her. Mother, she flouted me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The daring tawpie!&#8221; exclaimed Margaret.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is all that,&#8221; said the minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was she dressed just like an ordinary gypsy body?
But you don&#8217;t notice clothes much, Gavin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I noticed hers,&#8221; Gavin said, slowly, &#8220;she was in a
green and red, I think, and barefooted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; shouted Jean from the kitchen, startling both
of them; &#8220;but she had a lang grey-like cloak too. She
was seen jouking up closes in&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin rose, considerably annoyed, and shut the parlour
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was she as bonny as folks say?&#8221; asked Margaret.
&#8220;Jean says they speak of her beauty as unearthly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beauty of her kind,&#8221; Gavin explained learnedly,
&#8220;is neither earthly nor heavenly.&#8221; He was seeing
things as they are very clearly now. &#8220;What,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;is mere physical beauty? Pooh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; said Margaret, &#8220;the soul surely does
speak through the face to some extent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really think so, mother?&#8221; Gavin asked, a
little uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always noticed it,&#8221; Margaret said, and then
her son sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I would let no face influence me a jot,&#8221; he said,
recovering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Gavin, I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;m the reason you pay so
little regard to women&#8217;s faces. It&#8217;s no natural.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve spoilt me, you see, mother, for ever caring
for another woman. I would compare her to you, and
then where would she be?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Sometime,&#8221; Margaret said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll think differently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; answered Gavin, with a violence that ended
the conversation.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards he set off for the town, and in passing
down the garden walk cast a guilty glance at the
summer-seat. Something black was lying in one corner
of it. He stopped irresolutely, for his mother was
nodding to him from her window. Then he disappeared
into the little arbour. What had caught his eye was a
Bible. On the previous day, as he now remembered,
he had been called away while studying in the garden,
and had left his Bible on the summer-seat, a pencil between
its pages. Not often probably had the Egyptian
passed a night in such company.</p>
<p>But what was this? Gavin had not to ask himself
the question. The gypsy&#8217;s cloak was lying neatly
folded at the other end of the seat. Why had the
woman not taken it with her? Hardly had he put this
question when another stood in front of it. What was
to be done with the cloak? He dared not leave it there
for Jean to discover. He could not take it into the
manse in daylight. Beneath the seat was a tool-chest
without a lid, and into this he crammed the cloak.
Then, having turned the box face downwards, he went
about his duties. But many a time during the day he
shivered to the marrow, reflecting suddenly that at this
very moment Jean might be carrying the accursed thing
(at arms&#8217; length, like a dog in disgrace) to his mother.</p>
<p>Now let those who think that Gavin has not yet paid
toll for taking the road with the Egyptian, follow the
adventures of the cloak. Shortly after gloaming fell
that night Jean encountered her master in the lobby of
the manse. He was carrying something, and when he
saw her he slipped it behind his back. Had he passed
her openly she would have suspected nothing, but this
made her look at him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why do you stare so, Jean?&#8221; Gavin asked, conscience-stricken,
and he stood with his back to the wall
until she had retired in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have noticed her watching me sharply all day,&#8221;
he said to himself, though it was only he who had been
watching her.</p>
<p>Gavin carried the cloak to his bedroom, thinking to
lock it away in his chest, but it looked so wicked
lying there that he seemed to see it after the lid was
shut.</p>
<p>The garret was the best place for it. He took it out
of the chest and was opening his door gently, when
there was Jean again. She had been employed very
innocently in his mother&#8217;s room, but he said tartly&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean, I really cannot have this,&#8221; which sent Jean to
the kitchen with her apron at her eyes.</p>
<p>Gavin stowed the cloak beneath the garret bed, and
an hour afterwards was engaged on his sermon, when
he distinctly heard some one in the garret. He ran up
the ladder with a terrible brow for Jean, but it was not
Jean; it was Margaret.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he said in alarm, &#8220;what are you doing
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am only tidying up the garret, Gavin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;it is too cold for you. Did Jean&mdash;did
Jean ask you to come up here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean? She knows her place better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin took Margaret down to the parlour, but his
confidence in the garret had gone. He stole up the
ladder again, dragged the cloak from its lurking place,
and took it into the garden. He very nearly met Jean
in the lobby again, but hearing him coming she fled
precipitately, which he thought very suspicious.</p>
<p>In the garden he dug a hole, and there buried the
cloak, but even now he was not done with it. He was
wakened early by a noise of scraping in the garden, and
his first thought was &#8220;Jean!&#8221; But peering from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
window, he saw that the resurrectionist was a dog,
which already had its teeth in the cloak.</p>
<p>That forenoon Gavin left the manse unostentatiously
carrying a brown-paper parcel. He proceeded to the
hill, and having dropped the parcel there, retired hurriedly.
On his way home, nevertheless, he was over-taken
by D. Fittis, who had been cutting down whins.
Fittis had seen the parcel fall, and running after Gavin,
returned it to him. Gavin thanked D. Fittis, and then
sat down gloomily on the cemetery dyke. Half an
hour afterwards he flung the parcel into a Tillyloss
garden.</p>
<p>In the evening Margaret had news for him, got from
Jean.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember, Gavin, that the Egyptian every
one is still speaking of, wore a long cloak? Well,
would you believe it, the cloak was Captain Halliwell&#8217;s,
and she took it from the town-house when she escaped.
She is supposed to have worn it inside out. He did
not discover that it was gone until he was leaving
Thrums.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, is this possible?&#8221; Gavin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The policeman, Wearyworld, has told it. He was
ordered, it seems, to look for the cloak quietly, and to
take any one into custody in whose possession it was
found.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has it been found?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>The minister walked out of the parlour, for he could
not trust his face. What was to be done now? The
cloak was lying in mason Baxter&#8217;s garden, and Baxter
was therefore, in all probability, within four-and-twenty
hours of the Tilliedrum gaol.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Mr. Dishart ever wear a cap at nichts?&#8221;
Femie Wilkie asked Sam&#8217;l Fairweather three hours
later.</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, na, he has ower muckle respect for his lum
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
hat,&#8221; answered Sam&#8217;l; &#8220;and richtly, for it&#8217;s the crowning
stone o&#8217; the edifice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it couldna hae been him I met at the back o&#8217;
Tillyloss the now,&#8221; said Femie, &#8220;though like him it
was. He joukit back when he saw me.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Femie was telling her story in the Tenements,
mason Baxter, standing at the window which looked
into his garden, was shouting, &#8220;Wha&#8217;s that in my
yard?&#8221; There was no answer, and Baxter closed his
window, under the impression that he had been speaking
to a cat. The man in the cap then emerged from
the corner where he had been crouching, and stealthily
felt for something among the cabbages and pea sticks.
It was no longer there, however, and by-and-by he retired
empty-handed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Egyptian&#8217;s cloak has been found,&#8221; Margaret
was able to tell Gavin next day. &#8220;Mason Baxter found
it yesterday afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In his garden?&#8221; Gavin asked hurriedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; in the quarry, he says, but according to Jean
he is known not to have been at the quarry to-day.
Some seem to think that the gypsy gave him the cloak
for helping her to escape, and that he has delivered it
up lest he should get into difficulties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom has he given it to, mother?&#8221; Gavin asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the policeman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And has Wearyworld sent it back to Halliwell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He told Jean he sent it off at once, with the
information that the masons had found it in the quarry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day was Sabbath, when a new trial, now to
be told, awaited Gavin in the pulpit; but it had nothing
to do with the cloak, of which I may here record the
end. Wearyworld had not forwarded it to its owner;
Meggy, his wife, took care of that. It made its reappearance
in Thrums, several months after the riot, as two
pairs of Sabbath breeks for her sons, James and Andrew.</p>

<h2>Chapter Ten.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />FIRST SERMON AGAINST WOMEN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>On the afternoon of the following Sabbath, as I have
said, something strange happened in the Auld Licht
pulpit. The congregation, despite their troubles,
turned it over and peered at it for days, but had they
seen into the inside of it they would have weaved few
webs until the session had sat on the minister. The
affair baffled me at the time, and for the Egyptian&#8217;s
sake I would avoid mentioning it now, were it not one
of Gavin&#8217;s milestones. It includes the first of his
memorable sermons against Woman.</p>
<p>I was not in the Auld Licht church that day, but I
heard of the sermon before night, and this, I think, is
as good an opportunity as another for showing how the
gossip about Gavin reached me up here in the Glen
school-house. Since Margaret and her son came to the
manse I had kept the vow made to myself and avoided
Thrums. Only once had I ventured to the kirk, and
then, instead of taking my old seat, the fourth from the
pulpit, I sat down near the plate, where I could look at
Margaret without her seeing me. To spare her that
agony I even stole away as the last word of the benediction
was pronounced, and my haste scandalised
many, for with Auld Lichts it is not customary to retire
quickly from the church after the manner of the godless
U. P.&#8217;s (and the Free Kirk is little better), who have
their hats in their hand when they rise for the benediction,
so that they may at once pour out like a burst
dam. We resume our seats, look straight before us,
clear our throats and stretch out our hands for our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
womenfolk to put our hats into them. In time we do
get out, but I am never sure how.</p>
<p>One may gossip in a glen on Sabbaths, though not in
a town, without losing his character, and I used to await
the return of my neighbour, the farmer of Waster
Lunny, and of Silva Birse, the Glen Quharity post, at
the end of the school-house path. Waster Lunny was a
man whose care in his leisure hours was to keep from
his wife his great pride in her. His horse, Catlaw, on
the other hand, he told outright what he thought of it,
praising it to its face and blackguarding it as it deserved,
and I have seen him when completely baffled by the
brute, sit down before it on a stone and thus harangue:
&#8220;You think you&#8217;re clever, Catlaw, my lass, but you&#8217;re
mista&#8217;en. You&#8217;re a thrawn limmer, that&#8217;s what you
are. You think you have blood in you. You hae
blood! Gae away, and dinna blether. I tell you what,
Catlaw, I met a man yestreen that kent your mither,
and he says she was a feikie fushionless besom. What
do you say to that?&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the post, I will say no more of him than that
his bitter topic was the unreasonableness of humanity,
which treated him graciously when he had a letter for
it, but scowled at him when he had none, &#8220;aye implying
that I hae a letter, but keep it back.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the Sabbath evening after the riot, I stood at the
usual place awaiting my friends, and saw before they
reached me that they had something untoward to tell.
The farmer, his wife and three children, holding each
other&#8217;s hands, stretched across the road. Birse was a
little behind, but a conversation was being kept up by
shouting. All were walking the Sabbath pace, and the
family having started half a minute in advance, the
post had not yet made up on them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sitting to snaw,&#8221; Waster Lunny said, drawing
near, and just as I was to reply, &#8220;It is so,&#8221; Silva slipped
in the words before me.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You wasna at the kirk,&#8221; was Elspeth&#8217;s salutation.
I had been at the Glen church, but did not contradict
her, for it is Established, and so neither here nor there.
I was anxious, too, to know what their long faces
meant, and so asked at once&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was Mr. Dishart on the riot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forenoon, ay; afternoon, no,&#8221; replied Waster
Lunny, walking round his wife to get nearer me.
&#8220;Dominie, a queery thing happened in the kirk this
day, sic as&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Waster Lunny,&#8221; interrupted Elspeth sharply; &#8220;have
you on your Sabbath shoon or have you no on your
Sabbath shoon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guid care you took I should hae the dagont oncanny
things on,&#8221; retorted the farmer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep out o&#8217; the gutter, then,&#8221; said Elspeth, &#8220;on the
Lord&#8217;s day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Him,&#8221; said her man, &#8220;that is forced by a foolish
woman to wear genteel &#8217;lastic-sided boots canna forget
them till he takes them aff. Whaur&#8217;s the extra reverence
in wearing shoon twa sizes ower sma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It mayna be mair reverent,&#8221; suggested Birse, to
whom Elspeth&#8217;s kitchen was a pleasant place, &#8220;but it&#8217;s
grand, and you canna expect to be baith grand and
comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>I reminded them that they were speaking of Mr.
Dishart.</p>
<p>&#8220;We was saying,&#8221; began the post briskly, &#8220;that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was me that was saying it,&#8221; said Waster Lunny.
&#8220;So, dominie&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haud your gabs, baith o&#8217; you,&#8221; interrupted Elspeth.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve been roaring the story to ane another till
you&#8217;re hoarse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the forenoon,&#8221; Waster Lunny went on determinedly,
&#8220;Mr. Dishart preached on the riot, and fine he
was. Oh, dominie, you should hae heard him ladling
it on to Lang Tammas, no by name but in sic a way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
that there was no mistaking wha he was preaching at,
Sal! oh losh! Tammas got it strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s dull in the uptake,&#8221; broke in the post, &#8220;by
what I expected. I spoke to him after the sermon, and
I says, just to see if he was properly humbled, &#8216;Ay,
Tammas,&#8217; I says, &#8216;them that discourse was preached
against, winna think themselves seven feet men for a
while again.&#8217; &#8216;Ay, Birse,&#8217; he answers, &#8216;and glad I am
to hear you admit it, for he had you in his eye.&#8217; I was
fair scunnered at Tammas the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dishart was preaching at the whole clanjamfray
o&#8217; you,&#8221; said Elspeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he was,&#8221; said her husband, leering; &#8220;but
you needna cast it at us, for, my certie, if the men got
it frae him in the forenoon, the women got it in the
afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He redd them up most michty,&#8221; said the post.
&#8220;Thae was his very words or something like them.
&#8216;Adam,&#8217; says he, &#8216;was an erring man, but aside Eve he
was respectable.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but it wasna a&#8217; women he meant,&#8221; Elspeth explained,
&#8220;for when he said that, he pointed his finger
direct at T&#8217;nowhead&#8217;s lassie, and I hope it&#8217;ll do her
good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I wonder,&#8221; I said, &#8220;that Mr. Dishart chose such
a subject to-day. I thought he would be on the riot at
both services.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll wonder mair,&#8221; said Elspeth, &#8220;when you hear
what happened afore he began the afternoon sermon.
But I canna get in a word wi&#8217; that man o&#8217; mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been speaking about it,&#8221; said Birse, &#8220;ever
since we left the kirk door. Tod, we&#8217;ve been sawing
it like seed a&#8217; alang the glen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we meant to tell you about it at once,&#8221; said
Waster Lunny; &#8220;but there&#8217;s aye so muckle to say about
a minister. Dagont, to hae ane keeps a body out o&#8217;
langour. Ay, but this breaks the drum. Dominie,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
either Mr. Dishart wasna weel, or he was in the devil&#8217;s
grip.&#8221;</p>
<p>This startled me, for the farmer was looking serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was weel eneuch,&#8221; said Birse, &#8220;for a heap o&#8217;
fowk speired at Jean if he had ta&#8217;en his porridge as
usual, and she admitted he had. But the lassie was
skeered hersel&#8217;, and said it was a mercy Mrs. Dishart
wasna in the kirk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why was she not there?&#8221; I asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he winna let her out in sic weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would tell me what happened,&#8221; I said
to Elspeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I will,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;if Waster Lunny would
haud his wheesht for a minute. You see the afternoon
diet began in the ordinary way, and a&#8217; was richt until
we came to the sermon. &#8216;You will find my text,&#8217; he
says, in his piercing voice, &#8216;in the eighth chapter of
Ezra.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And at thae words,&#8221; said Waster Lunny, &#8220;my heart
gae a loup, for Ezra is an unca ill book to find; ay, and
so is Ruth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I kent the books o&#8217; the Bible by heart,&#8221; said Elspeth,
scornfully, &#8220;when I was a sax year auld.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So did I,&#8221; said Waster Lunny, &#8220;and I ken them yet,
except when I&#8217;m hurried. When Mr. Dishart gave out
Ezra he a sort o&#8217; keeked round the kirk to find out if he
had puzzled onybody, and so there was a kind o&#8217; a competition
among the congregation wha would lay hand
on it first. That was what doited me. Ay, there was
Ruth when she wasna wanted, but Ezra, dagont, it
looked as if Ezra had jumped clean out o&#8217; the Bible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wasna the only distressed crittur,&#8221; said his
wife. &#8220;I was ashamed to see Eppie McLaren looking
up the order o&#8217; the books at the beginning o&#8217; the Bible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tibbie Birse was even mair brazen,&#8221; said the post,
&#8220;for the sly cuttie opened at Kings and pretended it
was Ezra.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>&#8220;None o&#8217; thae things would I do,&#8221; said Waster
Lunny, &#8220;and sal, I dauredna, for Davit Lunan was
glowering over my shuther. Ay, you may scrowl at
me, Elspeth Proctor, but as far back as I can mind,
Ezra has done me. Mony a time afore I start for the
kirk I take my Bible to a quiet place and look Ezra up.
In the very pew I says canny to mysel&#8217;, &#8216;Ezra, Nehemiah,
Esther, Job,&#8217; the which should be a help, but
the moment the minister gi&#8217;es out that awfu&#8217; book, away
goes Ezra like the Egyptian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you after her,&#8221; said Elspeth, &#8220;like the weavers
that wouldna fecht. You make a windmill of your
Bible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I winna admit I&#8217;m beat. Never mind, there&#8217;s
queer things in the world forby Ezra. How is cripples
aye so puffed up mair than other folk? How does flour-bread
aye fall on the buttered side?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will mind,&#8221; Elspeth said, &#8220;for I was terrified the
minister would admonish you frae the pulpit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He couldna hae done that, for was he no baffled to
find Ezra himsel&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Him no find Ezra!&#8221; cried Elspeth. &#8220;I hae telled
you a dozen times he found it as easy as you could yoke
a horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing can be explained in no other way,&#8221; said
her husband, doggedly, &#8220;if he was weel and in sound
mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the dominie can clear it up,&#8221; suggested the
post, &#8220;him being a scholar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then tell me what happened,&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Godsake, hae we no telled you?&#8221; Birse said. &#8220;I
thocht we had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a terrible scene,&#8221; said Elspeth, giving her
husband a shove. &#8220;As I said, Mr. Dishart gave out
Ezra eighth. Weel, I turned it up in a jiffy, and syne
looked cautiously to see how Eppie McLaren was getting
on. Just at that minute I heard a groan frae the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
pulpit. It didna stop short o&#8217; a groan. Ay, you may
be sure I looked quick at the minister, and there I saw
a sicht that would hae made the grandest gape. His
face was as white as a baker&#8217;s, and he had a sort of
fallen against the back o&#8217; the pulpit, staring demented-like
at his open Bible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I saw him,&#8221; said Birse, &#8220;put up his hand
atween him and the Book, as if he thocht it was to
jump at him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twice,&#8221; said Elspeth, &#8220;he tried to speak, and twice
he let the words fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; says Waster Lunny, &#8220;the whole congregation
admits, but I didna see it mysel&#8217;, for a&#8217; this time
you may picture me hunting savage-like for Ezra. I
thocht the minister was waiting till I found it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hendry Munn,&#8221; said Birse, &#8220;stood upon one leg,
wondering whether he should run to the session-house
for a glass of water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But by that time,&#8221; said Elspeth, &#8220;the fit had left
Mr. Dishart, or rather it had ta&#8217;en a new turn. He
grew red, and it&#8217;s gospel that he stamped his foot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had the face of one using bad words,&#8221; said the
post. &#8220;He didna swear, of course, but that was the
face he had on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I missed it,&#8221; said Waster Lunny, &#8220;for I was in full
cry after Ezra, with the sweat running down my face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the most astounding thing has yet to be telled,&#8221;
went on Elspeth. &#8220;The minister shook himsel&#8217; like
one wakening frae a nasty dream, and he cries in a
voice of thunder, just as if he was shaking his fist at
somebody&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He cries,&#8221; Birse interposed, cleverly, &#8220;he cries,
&#8216;You will find the text in Genesis, chapter three, verse
six.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Elspeth, &#8220;first he gave out one text, and
then he gave out another, being the most amazing thing
to my mind that ever happened in the town of Thrums.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
What will our children&#8217;s children think o&#8217;t? I wouldna
hae missed it for a pound note.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor me,&#8221; said Waster Lunny, &#8220;though I only got
the tail o&#8217;t. Dominie, no sooner had he said Genesis
third and sixth, than I laid my finger on Ezra. Was it
no provoking? Onybody can turn up Genesis, but it
needs an able-bodied man to find Ezra.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He preached on the Fall,&#8221; Elspeth said, &#8220;for an
hour and twenty-five minutes, but powerful though he
was I would rather he had telled us what made him gie
the go-by to Ezra.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All I can say,&#8221; said Waster Lunny, &#8220;is that I never
heard him mair awe-inspiring. Whaur has he got sic a
knowledge of women? He riddled them, he fair riddled
them, till I was ashamed o&#8217; being married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy kent whaur he got his knowledge of
women,&#8221; Birse explained, &#8220;it&#8217;s a&#8217; in the original Hebrew.
You can howk ony mortal thing out o&#8217; the
original Hebrew, the which all ministers hae at their
finger ends. What else makes them ken to jump a
verse now and then when giving out a psalm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasna women like me he denounced,&#8221; Elspeth
insisted, &#8220;but young lassies that leads men astray wi&#8217;
their abominable wheedling ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tod,&#8221; said her husband, &#8220;if they try their hands on
Mr. Dishart they&#8217;ll meet their match.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will,&#8221; chuckled the post. &#8220;The Hebrew&#8217;s a
grand thing, though teuch, I&#8217;m telled, michty teuch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His sublimest burst,&#8221; Waster Lunny came back to
tell me, &#8220;was about the beauty o&#8217; the soul being everything
and the beauty o&#8217; the face no worth a snuff.
What a scorn he has for bonny faces and toom souls!
I dinna deny but what a bonny face fell takes me, but
Mr. Dishart wouldna gie a blade o&#8217; grass for&#8217;t. Ay,
and I used to think that in their foolishness about
women there was dagont little differ atween the unlearned
and the highly edicated.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>The gossip about Gavin brought hitherto to the school-house
had been as bread to me, but this I did not like.
For a minister to behave thus was as unsettling to us as
a change of Government to Londoners, and I decided to
give my scholars a holiday on the morrow and tramp
into the town for fuller news. But all through the
night it snowed, and next day, and then intermittently
for many days, and every fall took the school miles
farther away from Thrums. Birse and the crows had
now the glen road to themselves, and even Birse had
twice or thrice to bed with me. At these times had he
not been so interested in describing his progress through
the snow, maintaining that the crying want of our glen
road was palings for postmen to kick their feet against,
he must have wondered why I always turned the talk to
the Auld Licht minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ony explanation o&#8217; his sudden change o&#8217; texts?&#8221;
Birse said, repeating my question. &#8220;Tod, and there is
and to spare, for I hear tell there&#8217;s saxteen explanations
in the Tenements alone. As Tammas Haggart says,
that&#8217;s a blessing, for if there had just been twa explanations
the kirk micht hae split on them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; he said at another time, &#8220;twa or three even
dared to question the minister, but I&#8217;m thinking they
made nothing o&#8217;t. The majority agrees that he was
just inspired to change his text. But Lang Tammas is
dour. Tammas telled the session a queer thing. He
says that after the diet o&#8217; worship on that eventful afternoon
Mr. Dishart carried the Bible out o&#8217; the pulpit
instead o&#8217; leaving that duty as usual to the kirk-officer.
Weel, Tammas, being precentor, has a richt, as you
ken, to leave the kirk by the session-house door, just
like the minister himsel&#8217;. He did so that afternoon,
and what, think you, did he see? He saw Mr. Dishart
tearing a page out o&#8217; the Bible, and flinging it savagely
into the session-house fire. You dinna credit it? Weel,
it&#8217;s staggering, but there&#8217;s Hendry Munn&#8217;s evidence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
too. Hendry took his first chance o&#8217; looking up Ezra
in the minister&#8217;s Bible, and, behold, the page wi&#8217; the
eighth chapter was gone. Them that thinks Tammas
wasna blind wi&#8217; excitement hauds it had been Ezra
eighth that gaed into the fire. Onyway, there&#8217;s no
doubt about the page&#8217;s being missing, for whatever excitement
Tammas was in, Hendry was as cool as ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>A week later Birse told me that the congregation had
decided to regard the incident as adding lustre to their
kirk. This was largely, I fear, because it could then be
used to belittle the Established minister. That fervent
Auld Licht, Snecky Hobart, feeling that Gavin&#8217;s action
was unsound, had gone on the following Sabbath to the
parish kirk and sat under Mr. Duthie. But Mr. Duthie
was a close reader, so that Snecky flung himself about
in his pew in misery. The minister concluded his sermon
with these words: &#8220;But on this subject I will say
no more at present.&#8221; &#8220;Because you canna,&#8221; Snecky
roared, and strutted out of the church. Comparing the
two scenes, it is obvious that the Auld Lichts had won
a victory. After preaching impromptu for an hour and
twenty-five minutes, it could never be said of Gavin
that he needed to read. He became more popular than
ever. Yet the change of texts was not forgotten. If
in the future any other indictments were brought
against him, it would certainly be pinned to them.</p>
<p>I marvelled long over Gavin&#8217;s jump from Ezra to
Genesis, and at this his first philippic against Woman,
but I have known the cause for many a year. The
Bible was the one that had lain on the summer-seat
while the Egyptian hid there. It was the great pulpit
Bible which remains in the church as a rule, but Gavin
had taken it home the previous day to make some of
its loose pages secure with paste. He had studied from
it on the day preceding the riot, but had used a small
Bible during the rest of the week. When he turned in
the pulpit to Ezra, where he had left the large Bible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
open in the summer-seat, he found this scrawled across
chapter eight:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will never tell who flung the clod at Captain
Halliwell. But why did you fling it? I will never tell
that you allowed me to be called Mrs. Dishart before
witnesses. But is not this a Scotch marriage? Signed,
Babbie the Egyptian.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>No snow could be seen in Thrums by the beginning
of the year, though clods of it lay in Waster Lunny&#8217;s
fields, where his hens wandered all day as if looking for
something they had dropped. A black frost had set in,
and one walking on the glen road could imagine that
through the cracks in it he saw a loch glistening. From
my door I could hear the roar of curling stones at Rashie-bog,
which is almost four miles nearer Thrums. On
the day I am recalling, I see that I only made one entry
in my diary, &#8220;At last bought Waster Lunny&#8217;s bantams.&#8221;
Well do I remember the transaction, and no wonder, for
I had all but bought the bantams every day for a six
months.</p>
<p>About noon the doctor&#8217;s dogcart was observed by all
the Tenements standing at the Auld Licht manse. The
various surmises were wrong. Margaret had not been
suddenly taken ill; Jean had not swallowed a darning-needle;
the minister had not walked out at his study
window in a moment of sublime thought. Gavin stepped
into the dogcart, which at once drove off in the direction
of Rashie-bog, but equally in error were those who
said that the doctor was making a curler of him.</p>
<p>There was, however, ground for gossip; for Thrums
folk seldom called in a doctor until it was too late to
cure them, and McQueen was not the man to pay social
visits. Of his skill we knew fearsome stories, as that,
by looking at Archie Allardyce, who had come to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
broken bones on a ladder, he discovered which rung
Archie fell from. When he entered a stuffy room he
would poke his staff through the window to let in fresh
air, and then fling down a shilling to pay for the breakage.
He was deaf in the right ear, and therefore usually
took the left side of prosy people, thus, as he explained,
making a blessing of an affliction. &#8220;A pity I don&#8217;t
hear better?&#8221; I have heard him say. &#8220;Not at all. If
my misfortune, as you call it, were to be removed, you
can&#8217;t conceive how I should miss my deaf ear.&#8221; He
was a fine fellow, though brusque, and I never saw him
without his pipe until two days before we buried him,
which was five-and-twenty years ago come Martinmas.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all quite weel,&#8221; Jean said apprehensively as
she answered his knock on the manse door, and she
tried to be pleasant, too, for well she knew that, if a
doctor willed it, she could have fever in five minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, Jean, I&#8217;ll soon alter that,&#8221; he replied ferociously.
&#8220;Is the master in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s at his sermon,&#8221; Jean said with importance.</p>
<p>To interrupt the minister at such a moment seemed
sacrilege to her, for her up-bringing had been good.
Her mother had once fainted in the church, but though
the family&#8217;s distress was great, they neither bore her
out, nor signed to the kirk-officer to bring water. They
propped her up in the pew in a respectful attitude, joining
in the singing meanwhile, and she recovered in time
to look up 2nd Chronicles, 21st and 7th.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him I want to speak to him at the door,&#8221; said
the doctor fiercely, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll bleed you this minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>McQueen would not enter, because his horse might
have seized the opportunity to return stablewards. At
the houses where it was accustomed to stop, it drew up
of its own accord, knowing where the Doctor&#8217;s &#8220;cases&#8221;
were as well as himself, but it resented new patients.</p>
<p>&#8220;You like misery, I think, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; McQueen
said when Gavin came to him, &#8220;at least I am always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
finding you in the thick of it, and that is why I am here
now. I have a rare job for you if you will jump into
the machine. You know Nanny Webster, who lives on
the edge of Windyghoul? No, you don&#8217;t, for she belongs
to the other kirk. Well, at all events, you knew
her brother, Sanders, the mole-catcher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember him. You mean the man who boasted
so much about seeing a ball at Lord Rintoul&#8217;s place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same, and, as you may know, his boasting
about maltreating policemen whom he never saw led to
his being sentenced to nine months in gaol lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the man,&#8221; said Gavin. &#8220;I never liked
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but his sister did,&#8221; McQueen answered, drily,
&#8220;and with reason, for he was her breadwinner, and
now she is starving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything I can give her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would be too little, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the neighbours&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has few near her, and though the Thrums poor
help each other bravely, they are at present nigh as
needy as herself. Nanny is coming to the poorhouse,
Mr. Dishart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God help her!&#8221; exclaimed Gavin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said the doctor, trying to make himself
a hard man. &#8220;She will be properly looked after there,
and&mdash;and in time she will like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let my mother hear you speaking of taking an
old woman to that place,&#8221; Gavin said, looking anxiously
up the stair. I cannot pretend that Margaret never
listened.</p>
<p>&#8220;You all speak as if the poorhouse was a gaol,&#8221; the
doctor said testily. &#8220;But so far as Nanny is concerned,
everything is arranged. I promised to drive her to the
poorhouse to-day, and she is waiting for me now.
Don&#8217;t look at me as if I was a brute. She is to take
some of her things with her to the poorhouse and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
rest is to be left until Sanders&#8217;s return, when she may
rejoin him. At least we said that to her to comfort her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want me to go with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, though I warn you it may be a distressing
scene; indeed, the truth is that I am loth to face Nanny
alone to-day. Mr. Duthie should have accompanied
me, for the Websters are Established Kirk; ay, and so
he would if Rashie-bog had not been bearing. A terrible
snare this curling, Mr. Dishart&#8221;&mdash;here the doctor
sighed&mdash;&#8220;I have known Mr. Duthie wait until midnight
struck on Sabbath and then be off to Rashie-bog
with a torch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go with you,&#8221; Gavin said, putting on his coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jump in then. You won&#8217;t smoke? I never see a
respectable man not smoking, sir, but I feel indignant
with him for such sheer waste of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin smiled at this, and Snecky Hobart, who happened
to be keeking over the manse dyke, bore the news
to the Tenements.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll no sleep the nicht,&#8221; Snecky said, &#8220;for wondering
what made the minister lauch. Ay, it would be no
trifle.&#8221;</p>
<p>A minister, it is certain, who wore a smile on his
face would never have been called to the Auld Licht
kirk, for life is a wrestle with the devil, and only the
frivolous think to throw him without taking off their
coats. Yet, though Gavin&#8217;s zeal was what the congregation
reverenced, many loved him privately for his
boyishness. He could unbend at marriages, of which
he had six on the last day of the year, and at every one
of them he joked (the same joke) like a layman. Some
did not approve of his playing at the teetotum for ten
minutes with Kitty Dundas&#8217;s invalid son, but the way
Kitty boasted about it would have disgusted anybody.
At the present day there are probably a score of Gavins
in Thrums, all called after the little minister, and there
is one Gavinia, whom he hesitated to christen. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
made humorous remarks (the same remark) about all
these children, and his smile as he patted their heads
was for thinking over when one&#8217;s work was done for the
day.</p>
<p>The doctor&#8217;s horse clattered up the Backwynd noisily,
as if a minister behind made no difference to it. Instead
of climbing the Roods, however, the nearest way
to Nanny&#8217;s, it went westward, which Gavin, in a reverie,
did not notice. The truth must be told. The Egyptian
was again in his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I fallen deaf in the left ear, too?&#8221; said the
doctor. &#8220;I see your lips moving, but I don&#8217;t catch a
syllable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin started, coloured, and flung the gypsy out of
the trap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are we not going up the Roods?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the doctor slowly, &#8220;at the top of the
Roods there is a stance for circuses, and this old beast
of mine won&#8217;t pass it. You know, unless you are behind
in the clashes and clavers of Thrums, that I bought
her from the manager of a travelling show. She was
the horse (&#8216;Lightning&#8217; they called her) that galloped
round the ring at a mile an hour, and so at the top of
the Roods she is still unmanageable. She once dragged
me to the scene of her former triumphs, and went revolving
round it, dragging the machine after her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had not explained that,&#8221; said Gavin, &#8220;I might
have thought that you wanted to pass by Rashie-bog.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor, indeed, was already standing up to catch
a first glimpse of the curlers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;I might have managed to pass
the circus ring, though what I have told you is true.
However, I have not come this way merely to see how
the match is going. I want to shame Mr. Duthie for
neglecting his duty. It will help me to do mine, for
the Lord knows I am finding it hard, with the music
of these stones in my ears.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I never saw it played before,&#8221; Gavin said, standing
up in his turn. &#8220;What a din they make! McQueen, I
believe they are fighting!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said the excited doctor, &#8220;they are just a
bit daft. That&#8217;s the proper spirit for the game. Look,
that&#8217;s the baron-bailie near standing on his head, and
there&#8217;s Mr. Duthie off his head a&#8217; thegither. Yon&#8217;s
twa weavers and a mason cursing the laird, and the man
wi&#8217; the besom is the Master of Crumnathie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A democracy, at all events,&#8221; said Gavin.</p>
<p>&#8220;By no means,&#8221; said the doctor, &#8220;it&#8217;s an aristocracy
of intellect. Gee up, Lightning, or the frost will be
gone before we are there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my opinion, doctor,&#8221; said Gavin, &#8220;that you will
have bones to set before that game is finished. I can
see nothing but legs now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say a word against curling, sir, to me,&#8221; said
McQueen, whom the sight of a game in which he must
not play had turned crusty. &#8220;Dangerous! It&#8217;s the best
medicine I know of. Look at that man coming across
the field. It is Jo Strachan. Well, sir, curling saved
Jo&#8217;s life after I had given him up. You don&#8217;t believe
me? Hie, Jo, Jo Strachan, come here and tell the minister
how curling put you on your legs again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strachan came forward, a tough, little, wizened
man, with red flannel round his ears to keep out the
cold.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gospel what the doctor says, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;Me and my brither Sandy was baith ill,
and in the same bed, and the doctor had hopes o&#8217; Sandy,
but nane o&#8217; me. Ay, weel, when I heard that, I thocht
I micht as weel die on the ice as in my bed, so I up and
on wi&#8217; my claethes. Sandy was mad at me, for he was
no curler, and he says, &#8216;Jo Strachan, if you gang to
Rashie-bog you&#8217;ll assuredly be brocht hame a corp.&#8217; I
didna heed him, though, and off I gaed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I see you did not die,&#8221; said Gavin.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Not me,&#8221; answered the fish cadger, with a grin.
&#8220;Na, but the joke o&#8217;t is, it was Sandy that died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the joke, Jo,&#8221; corrected the doctor, &#8220;the moral.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, the moral; I&#8217;m aye forgetting the word.&#8221;</p>
<p>McQueen, enjoying Gavin&#8217;s discomfiture, turned
Lightning down the Rashie-bog road, which would be
impassable as soon as the thaw came. In summer
Rashie-bog is several fields in which a cart does not
sink unless it stands still, but in winter it is a loch with
here and there a spring where dead men are said to lie.
There are no rushes at its east end, and here the dogcart
drew up near the curlers, a crowd of men dancing,
screaming, shaking their fists and sweeping, while half
a hundred onlookers got in their way, gesticulating and
advising.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold me tight,&#8221; the doctor whispered to Gavin, &#8220;or
I&#8217;ll be leaving you to drive Nanny to the poorhouse by
yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had no sooner said this than he tried to jump out
of the trap.</p>
<p>&#8220;You donnert fule, John Robbie,&#8221; he shouted to a
player, &#8220;soop her up, man, soop her up; no, no, dinna,
dinna; leave her alane. Bailie, leave her alane, you
blazing idiot. Mr. Dishart, let me go; what do you
mean, sir, by hanging on to my coat tails? Dang it
all, Duthie&#8217;s winning. He has it, he has it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re to play, doctor?&#8221; some cried, running to the
dogcart. &#8220;We hae missed you sair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeames, I&mdash;I&mdash;. No, I daurna.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we get our licks. I never saw the minister in
sic form. We can do nothing against him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; cried McQueen, &#8220;I&#8217;ll play. Come what
will, I&#8217;ll play. Let go my tails, Mr. Dishart, or I&#8217;ll
cut them off. Duty? Fiddlesticks!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shame on you, sir,&#8221; said Gavin; &#8220;yes, and on you
others who would entice him from his duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shame!&#8221; the doctor cried. &#8220;Look at Mr. Duthie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
Is he ashamed? And yet that man has been reproving
me for a twelvemonths because I&#8217;ve refused to become
one of his elders. Duthie,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;think shame
of yourself for curling this day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Duthie had carefully turned his back to the trap,
for Gavin&#8217;s presence in it annoyed him. We seldom
care to be reminded of our duty by seeing another do
it. Now, however, he advanced to the dogcart, taking
the far side of Gavin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put on your coat, Mr. Duthie,&#8221; said the doctor,
&#8220;and come with me to Nanny Webster&#8217;s. You promised.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Duthie looked quizzically at Gavin, and then at
the sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thaw may come at any moment,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the frost is to hold,&#8221; said Gavin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may hold over to-morrow,&#8221; Mr. Duthie admitted;
&#8220;but to-morrow&#8217;s the Sabbath, and so a lost day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221; exclaimed Gavin, horrified.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only mean,&#8221; Mr. Duthie answered, colouring,
&#8220;that we can&#8217;t curl on the Lord&#8217;s day. As for what it
may be like on Monday, no one can say. No, doctor,
I won&#8217;t risk it. We&#8217;re in the middle of a game,
man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin looked very grave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see what you are thinking, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; the old
minister said doggedly; &#8220;but then, you don&#8217;t curl.
You are very wise. I have forbidden my sons to
curl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you openly snap your fingers at your duty,
Mr. Duthie?&#8221; said the doctor, loftily. (&#8220;You can let
go my tails now, Mr. Dishart, for the madness has
passed.&#8221;)</p>
<p>&#8220;None of your virtuous airs, McQueen,&#8221; said Mr.
Duthie, hotly. &#8220;What was the name of the doctor that
warned women never to have bairns while it was hauding?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And what,&#8221; retorted McQueen, &#8220;was the name of
the minister that told his session he would neither
preach nor pray while the black frost lasted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoots, doctor,&#8221; said Duthie, &#8220;don&#8217;t lose your temper
because I&#8217;m in such form.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lose yours, Duthie, because I aye beat
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You beat me, McQueen! Go home, sir, and don&#8217;t
talk havers. Who beat you at&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who made you sing small at&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who won&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll play you on Monday for whatever you like!&#8221;
shrieked the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it holds,&#8221; cried the minister, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be here the
whole day. Name the stakes yourself. A stone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the doctor said, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll tell you what we&#8217;ll
play for. You&#8217;ve been dinging me doited about that
eldership, and we&#8217;ll play for&#8217;t. If you win I accept
office.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Done,&#8221; said the minister, recklessly.</p>
<p>The dogcart was now turned toward Windyghoul,
its driver once more good-humoured, but Gavin silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would have been the better of my deaf ear just
now, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; McQueen said after the loch had
been left behind. &#8220;Aye, and I&#8217;m thinking my pipe
would soothe you. But don&#8217;t take it so much to heart,
man. I&#8217;ll lick him easily. He&#8217;s a decent man, the
minister, but vain of his play, ridiculously vain. However,
I think the sight of you, in the place that should
have been his, has broken his nerve for this day, and
our side may win yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; Gavin said, with sudden enlightenment,
&#8220;that you brought me here for that purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; chuckled the doctor; &#8220;maybe.&#8221; Then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
changed the subject suddenly. &#8220;Mr. Dishart,&#8221; he
asked, &#8220;were you ever in love?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; answered Gavin violently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said the doctor, &#8220;don&#8217;t terrify the
horse. I have been in love myself. It&#8217;s bad, but it&#8217;s
nothing to curling.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Chapter Twelve.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />TRAGEDY OF A MUD HOUSE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The dogcart bumped between the trees of Caddam,
flinging Gavin and the doctor at each other as a wheel
rose on some beech-root or sank for a moment in a pool.
I suppose the wood was a pretty sight that day, the
pines only white where they had met the snow, as if the
numbed painter had left his work unfinished, the brittle
twigs snapping overhead, the water as black as tar.
But it matters little what the wood was like. Within
a squirrel&#8217;s leap of it an old woman was standing at the
door of a mud house listening for the approach of the
trap that was to take her to the poorhouse. Can you
think of the beauty of the day now?</p>
<p>Nanny was not crying. She had redd up her house
for the last time and put on her black merino. Her
mouth was wide open while she listened. If you had
addressed her you would have thought her polite and
stupid. Look at her. A flabby-faced woman she is
now, with a swollen body, and no one has heeded her
much these thirty years. I can tell you something; it
is almost droll. Nanny Webster was once a gay flirt,
and in Airlie Square there is a weaver with an unsteady
head who thought all the earth of her. His loom has
taken a foot from his stature, and gone are Nanny&#8217;s
raven locks on which he used to place his adoring hand.
Down in Airlie Square he is weaving for his life, and
here is Nanny, ripe for the poorhouse, and between
them is the hill where they were lovers. That is all
the story save that when Nanny heard the dogcart she
screamed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></div>
<p>No neighbour was with her. If you think this hard,
it is because you do not understand. Perhaps Nanny
had never been very lovable except to one man, and
him, it is said, she lost through her own vanity; but
there was much in her to like. The neighbours, of
whom there were two not a hundred yards away, would
have been with her now but they feared to hurt her
feelings. No heart opens to sympathy without letting
in delicacy, and these poor people knew that Nanny
would not like them to see her being taken away. For
a week they had been aware of what was coming, and
they had been most kind to her, but that hideous word,
the poorhouse, they had not uttered. Poorhouse is not
to be spoken in Thrums, though it is nothing to tell a
man that you see death in his face. Did Nanny think
they knew where she was going? was a question they
whispered to each other, and her suffering eyes cut
scars on their hearts. So now that the hour had come
they called their children into their houses and pulled
down their blinds.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you would like to see her by yourself,&#8221; the doctor
said eagerly to Gavin, as the horse drew up at Nanny&#8217;s
gate, &#8220;I&#8217;ll wait with the horse. Not,&#8221; he added, hastily,
&#8220;that I feel sorry for her. We are doing her a
kindness.&#8221;</p>
<p>They dismounted together, however, and Nanny, who
had run from the trap into the house, watched them
from her window.</p>
<p>McQueen saw her and said glumly, &#8220;I should have
come alone, for if you pray she is sure to break down.
Mr. Dishart, could you not pray cheerfully?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look very cheerful yourself,&#8221; Gavin said
sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; answered the doctor. &#8220;I have no
patience with this false sentiment. Stand still, Lightning,
and be thankful you are not your master to-day.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>The door stood open, and Nanny was crouching
against the opposite wall of the room, such a poor, dull
kitchen, that you would have thought the furniture had
still to be brought into it. The blanket and the piece
of old carpet that was Nanny&#8217;s coverlet were already
packed in her box. The plate rack was empty. Only
the round table and the two chairs, and the stools and
some pans were being left behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Nanny,&#8221; the doctor said, trying to bluster, &#8220;I
have come, and you see Mr. Dishart is with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanny rose bravely. She knew the doctor was good
to her, and she wanted to thank him. I have not seen
a great deal of the world myself, but often the sweet
politeness of the aged poor has struck me as beautiful.
Nanny dropped a curtesy, an ungainly one maybe, but
it was an old woman giving the best she had.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you kindly, sirs,&#8221; she said; and then two
pairs of eyes dropped before hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please to take a chair,&#8221; she added timidly. It is
strange to know that at that awful moment, for let none
tell me it was less than awful, the old woman was the
one who could speak.</p>
<p>Both men sat down, for they would have hurt Nanny
by remaining standing. Some ministers would have
known the right thing to say to her, but Gavin dared
not let himself speak. I have again to remind you that
he was only one-and-twenty.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m drouthy, Nanny,&#8221; the doctor said, to give her
something to do, &#8220;and I would be obliged for a drink
of water.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanny hastened to the pan that stood behind her
door, but stopped before she reached it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s toom,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&mdash;I didna think I needed to
fill it this morning.&#8221; She caught the doctor&#8217;s eye, and
could only half restrain a sob. &#8220;I couldna help that,&#8221;
she said, apologetically. &#8220;I&#8217;m richt angry at myself
for being so ungrateful like.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>The doctor thought it best that they should depart at
once. He rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, doctor,&#8221; cried Nanny in alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I have been ready this twa hours,
but you micht wait a minute. Hendry Munn and Andrew
Allardyce is coming yont the road, and they would
see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, doctor,&#8221; Gavin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you kindly, sir,&#8221; answered Nanny.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Nanny,&#8221; the doctor said, &#8220;you must remember
what I told you about the poo&mdash;, about the place you
are going to. It is a fine house, and you will be very
happy in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I&#8217;ll be happy in&#8217;t,&#8221; Nanny faltered, &#8220;but, doctor,
if I could just hae bidden on here though I wasna
happy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of the food you will get; broth nearly every
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&mdash;it&#8217;ll be terrible enjoyable,&#8221; Nanny said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And there will be pleasant company for you always,&#8221;
continued the doctor, &#8220;and a nice room to sit in.
Why, after you have been there a week, you won&#8217;t be
the same woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; cried Nanny with sudden passion.
&#8220;Na, na; I&#8217;ll be a woman on the poor&#8217;s rates. Oh,
mither, mither, you little thocht when you bore me that
I would come to this!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanny,&#8221; the doctor said, rising again, &#8220;I am
ashamed of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I humbly speir your forgiveness, sir,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and you micht bide just a wee yet. I&#8217;ve been ready
to gang these twa hours, but now that the machine is
at the gate, I dinna ken how it is, but I&#8217;m terrible
sweer to come awa&#8217;. Oh, Mr. Dishart, it&#8217;s richt true
what the doctor says about the&mdash;the place, but I canna
just take it in. I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m gey auld.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You will often get out to see your friends,&#8221; was all
Gavin could say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, na, na,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;dinna say that; I&#8217;ll gang,
but you mauna bid me ever come out, except in a
hearse. Dinna let onybody in Thrums look on my face
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must go,&#8221; said the doctor firmly. &#8220;Put on your
mutch, Nanny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna need to put on a mutch,&#8221; she answered, with
a faint flush of pride. &#8220;I have a bonnet.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took the bonnet from her bed, and put it on
slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure there&#8217;s naebody looking?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>The doctor glanced at the minister, and Gavin
rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us pray,&#8221; he said, and the three went down on
their knees.</p>
<p>It was not the custom of Auld Licht ministers to
leave any house without offering up a prayer in it, and
to us it always seemed that when Gavin prayed, he was
at the knees of God. The little minister pouring himself
out in prayer in a humble room, with awed people
around him who knew much more of the world than he,
his voice at times thick and again a squeal, and his
hands clasped not gracefully, may have been only a
comic figure, but we were old-fashioned, and he seemed
to make us better men. If I only knew the way, I
would draw him as he was, and not fear to make him
too mean a man for you to read about. He had not
been long in Thrums before he knew that we talked
much of his prayers, and that doubtless puffed him up
a little. Sometimes, I daresay, he rose from his knees
feeling that he had prayed well to-day, which is a
dreadful charge to bring against any one. But it was
not always so, nor was it so now.</p>
<p>I am not speaking harshly of this man, whom I have
loved beyond all others, when I say that Nanny came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
between him and his prayer. Had he been of God&#8217;s
own image, unstained, he would have forgotten all else
in his Maker&#8217;s presence, but Nanny was speaking too,
and her words choked his. At first she only whispered,
but soon what was eating her heart burst out painfully,
and she did not know that the minister had
stopped.</p>
<p>They were such moans as these that brought him back
to earth:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hae to gang.... I&#8217;m a base woman no&#8217; to be
mair thankfu&#8217; to them that is so good to me.... I
dinna like to prig wi&#8217; them to take a roundabout road,
and I&#8217;m sair fleid a&#8217; the Roods will see me.... If it
could just be said to poor Sanders when he comes back
that I died hurriedly, syne he would be able to haud
up his head.... Oh, mither!... I wish terrible
they had come and ta&#8217;en me at nicht.... It&#8217;s a dogcart,
and I was praying it micht be a cart, so that they
could cover me wi&#8217; straw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is more than I can stand,&#8221; the doctor cried.</p>
<p>Nanny rose frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve tried you, sair,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but, oh, I&#8217;m grateful,
and I&#8217;m ready now.&#8221;</p>
<p>They all advanced toward the door without another
word, and Nanny even tried to smile. But in the middle
of the floor something came over her, and she stood
there. Gavin took her hand, and it was cold. She
looked from one to the other, her mouth opening and
shutting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I canna help it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cruel hard,&#8221; muttered the doctor. &#8220;I knew this
woman when she was a lassie.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little minister stretched out his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have pity on her, O God!&#8221; he prayed, with the
presumptuousness of youth.</p>
<p>Nanny heard the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, God,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you micht!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>God needs no minister to tell Him what to do, but it
was His will that the poorhouse should not have this
woman. He made use of a strange instrument, no
other than the Egyptian, who now opened the mudhouse
door.</p>

<h2>Chapter Thirteen.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />SECOND COMING OF THE EGYPTIAN WOMAN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The gypsy had been passing the house, perhaps on
her way to Thrums for gossip, and it was only curiosity,
born suddenly of Gavin&#8217;s cry, that made her enter.
On finding herself in unexpected company she retained
hold of the door, and to the amazed minister she seemed
for a moment to have stepped into the mud house from
his garden. Her eyes danced, however, as they recognised
him, and then he hardened. &#8220;This is no place
for you,&#8221; he was saying fiercely, when Nanny, too distraught
to think, fell crying at the Egyptian&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are taking me to the poorhouse,&#8221; she sobbed;
&#8220;dinna let them, dinna let them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Egyptian&#8217;s arms clasped her, and the Egyptian
kissed a sallow cheek that had once been as fair as
yours, madam, who may read this story. No one had
caressed Nanny for many years, but do you think she
was too poor and old to care for these young arms
around her neck? There are those who say that women
cannot love each other, but it is not true. Woman is
not undeveloped man, but something better, and Gavin
and the doctor knew it as they saw Nanny clinging to
her protector. When the gypsy turned with flashing
eyes to the two men she might have been a mother
guarding her child.</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you!&#8221; she cried, stamping her foot; and
they quaked like malefactors.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Gavin began, but her indignation
stopped him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You coward!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Even the doctor had been impressed, so that he now
addressed the gypsy respectfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is all very well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but a woman&#8217;s
sympathy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman!&mdash;ah, if I could be a man for only five
minutes!&#8221;</p>
<p>She clenched her little fists, and again turned to
Nanny.</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor dear,&#8221; she said tenderly, &#8220;I won&#8217;t let
them take you away.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked triumphantly at both minister and doctor,
as one who had foiled them in their cruel designs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221; she said, pointing grandly to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this the Egyptian of the riots,&#8221; the doctor said
in a low voice to Gavin, &#8220;or is she a queen? Hoots,
man, don&#8217;t look so shamefaced. We are not criminals.
Say something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then to the Egyptian Gavin said firmly&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean well, but you are doing this poor woman
a cruelty in holding out hopes to her that cannot be
realised. Sympathy is not meal and bedclothes, and
these are what she needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you who live in luxury,&#8221; retorted the girl,
&#8220;would send her to the poorhouse for them. I thought
better of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tuts!&#8221; said the doctor, losing patience, &#8220;Mr. Dishart
gives more than any other man in Thrums to the
poor, and he is not to be preached to by a gypsy. We
are waiting for you, Nanny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I&#8217;m coming,&#8221; said Nanny, leaving the Egyptian.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll hae to gang, lassie. Dinna greet for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Egyptian said, &#8220;No, you are not going. It
is these men who are going. Go, sirs, and leave us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will provide for Nanny?&#8221; asked the doctor
contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And where is the siller to come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my affair, and Nanny&#8217;s. Begone, both of
you. She shall never want again. See how the very
mention of your going brings back life to her face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t begone,&#8221; the doctor said roughly, &#8220;till I see
the colour of your siller.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the money,&#8221; said the Egyptian scornfully. She
put her hand into her pocket confidently, as if used to
well-filled purses, but could only draw out two silver
pieces.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had forgotten,&#8221; she said aloud, though speaking
to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; said the cynical doctor. &#8220;Come,
Nanny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You presume to doubt me!&#8221; the Egyptian said,
blocking his way to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I presume to believe you?&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;You are a beggar by profession, and yet talk as if&mdash;&mdash;pooh,
nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would live on terrible little,&#8221; Nanny whispered,
&#8220;and Sanders will be out again in August month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven shillings a week,&#8221; rapped out the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; the Egyptian asked. &#8220;She shall have
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At once. No, it is not possible to-night, but to-morrow
I will bring five pounds; no, I will send it; no,
you must come for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where, O daughter of Dives, do you reside?&#8221;
the doctor asked.</p>
<p>No doubt the Egyptian could have found a ready answer
had her pity for Nanny been less sincere; as it
was, she hesitated, wanting to propitiate the doctor,
while holding her secret fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only asked,&#8221; McQueen said, eyeing her curiously,
&#8220;because when I make an appointment I like to know
where it is to be held. But I suppose you are suddenly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
to rise out of the ground as you have done to-day, and
did six weeks ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether I rise out of the ground or not,&#8221; the gypsy
said, keeping her temper with an effort, &#8220;there will be
a five-pound note in my hand. You will meet me to-morrow
about this hour at&mdash;say the Kaims of Cushie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the doctor after a moment&#8217;s pause; &#8220;I
won&#8217;t. Even if I went to the Kaims I should not find
you there. Why can you not come to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you carry a woman&#8217;s hair,&#8221; replied the
Egyptian, &#8220;in that locket on your chain?&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether she was speaking of what she knew, or this
was only a chance shot, I cannot tell, but the doctor
stepped back from her hastily, and could not help looking
down at the locket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Egyptian calmly, &#8220;it is still shut; but
why do you sometimes open it at nights?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lassie,&#8221; the old doctor cried, &#8220;are you a witch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she said; &#8220;but I ask for no answer to my
questions. If you have your secrets, why may I not
have mine? Now will you meet me at the Kaims?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I distrust you more than ever. Even if you
came, it would be to play with me as you have done
already. How can a vagrant have five pounds in her
pocket when she does not have five shillings on her
back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a cruel, hard man,&#8221; the Egyptian said, beginning
to lose hope. &#8220;But, see,&#8221; she cried, brightening,
&#8220;look at this ring. Do you know its value?&#8221;</p>
<p>She held up her finger, but the stone would not live
in the dull light.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see it is gold,&#8221; the doctor said cautiously, and she
smiled at the ignorance that made him look only at the
frame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, it is gold,&#8221; said Gavin, equally stupid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy on us!&#8221; Nanny cried; &#8220;I believe it&#8217;s what
they call a diamond.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How did you come by it?&#8221; the doctor asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought we had agreed not to ask each other questions,&#8221;
the Egyptian answered drily. &#8220;But, see, I will
give it to you to hold in hostage. If I am not at the
Kaims to get it back you can keep it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor took the ring in his hand and examined it
curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a quirk in this,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;that I
don&#8217;t like. Take back your ring, lassie. Mr. Dishart,
give Nanny your arm, and I&#8217;ll carry her box to the
machine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now all this time Gavin had been in the dire distress
of a man possessed of two minds, of which one said,
&#8220;This is a true woman,&#8221; and the other, &#8220;Remember
the seventeenth of October.&#8221; They were at war within
him, and he knew that he must take a side, yet no
sooner had he cast one out than he invited it back. He
did not answer the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless,&#8221; McQueen said, nettled by his hesitation,
&#8220;you trust this woman&#8217;s word.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin tried honestly to weigh those two minds against
each other, but could not prevent impulse jumping into
one of the scales.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do trust me,&#8221; the Egyptian said, with wet eyes;
and now that he looked on her again&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said firmly, &#8220;I trust you,&#8221; and the words
that had been so difficult to say were the right words.
He had no more doubt of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think a moment first,&#8221; the doctor warned him.
&#8220;I decline to have anything to do with this matter.
You will go to the Kaims for the siller?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is necessary,&#8221; said Gavin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is necessary,&#8221; the Egyptian said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanny took his hand timidly, and would have kissed
it had he been less than a minister.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You dare not, man,&#8221; the doctor said gruffly, &#8220;make
an appointment with this gypsy. Think of what will
be said in Thrums.&#8221;</p>
<p>I honour Gavin for the way in which he took this
warning. For him, who was watched from the rising
of his congregation to their lying down, whose every
movement was expected to be a text to Thrums, it was
no small thing that he had promised. This he knew,
but he only reddened because the doctor had implied
an offensive thing in a woman&#8217;s presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget yourself, doctor,&#8221; he said sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Send some one in your place,&#8221; advised the doctor,
who liked the little minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;He must come himself and alone,&#8221; said the Egyptian.
&#8220;You must both give me your promise not to
mention who is Nanny&#8217;s friend, and she must promise
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the doctor, buttoning up his coat, &#8220;I
cannot keep my horse freezing any longer. Remember,
Mr. Dishart, you take the sole responsibility of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Gavin, &#8220;and with the utmost confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give him the ring then, lassie,&#8221; said McQueen.</p>
<p>She handed the minister the ring, but he would not
take it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have your word,&#8221; he said; &#8220;that is sufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the Egyptian gave him the first look that he
could think of afterwards without misgivings.</p>
<p>&#8220;So be it,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;Get the money, and I
will say nothing about it, unless I have reason to think
that it has been dishonestly come by. Don&#8217;t look so
frightened at me, Nanny. I hope for your sake that
her stocking-foot is full of gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely it&#8217;s worth risking,&#8221; Nanny said, not very
brightly, &#8220;when the minister&#8217;s on her side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but on whose side, Nanny?&#8221; asked the doctor.
&#8220;Lassie, I bear you no grudge; will you not tell me
who you are?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Only a puir gypsy, your honour,&#8221; said the girl, becoming
mischievous now that she had gained her point;
&#8220;only a wandering hallen-shaker, and will I tell you
your fortune, my pretty gentleman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you shan&#8217;t,&#8221; replied the doctor, plunging his
hands so hastily into his pockets that Gavin laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need to look at your hand,&#8221; said the gypsy,
&#8220;I can read your fortune in your face.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him fixedly, so that he fidgeted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you,&#8221; said the Egyptian in a sepulchral voice,
and speaking slowly, &#8220;become very frail. Your eyesight
has almost gone. You are sitting alone in a
cauld room, cooking your ain dinner ower a feeble fire.
The soot is falling down the lum. Your bearish manners
towards women have driven the servant lassie frae
your house, and your wife beats you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, you spoil your prophecy there,&#8221; the doctor said,
considerably relieved, &#8220;for I&#8217;m not married; my pipe&#8217;s
the only wife I ever had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be married by that time,&#8221; continued the
Egyptian, frowning at this interruption, &#8220;for I see your
wife. She is a shrew. She marries you in your dotage.
She lauchs at you in company. She doesna allow you
to smoke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Away with you, you jade,&#8221; cried the doctor in a
fury, and feeling nervously for his pipe. &#8220;Mr. Dishart,
you had better stay and arrange this matter as you
choose, but I want a word with you outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re no angry wi&#8217; me, doctor, are you?&#8221;
asked Nanny wistfully. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been richt good to
me, but I canna thole the thocht o&#8217; that place. And,
oh, doctor, you winna tell naebody that I was so near
taen to it?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the garden McQueen said to Gavin:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be right, Mr. Dishart, in this matter, for
there is this in our favour, that the woman can gain
nothing by tricking us. She did seem to feel for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
Nanny. But who can she be? You saw she could put
on and off the Scotch tongue as easily as if it were a
cap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is as much a mystery to me as to you,&#8221; Gavin
answered, &#8220;but she will give me the money, and that
is all I ask of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, that remains to be seen. But take care of yourself;
a man&#8217;s second childhood begins when a woman
gets hold of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t alarm yourself about me, doctor. I daresay
she is only one of those gypsies from the South. They
are said to be wealthy, many of them, and even, when
they like, to have a grand manner. The Thrums people
had no doubt but that she was what she seemed to
be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but what does she seem to be? Even that puzzles
me. And then there is this mystery about her
which she admits herself, though perhaps only to play
with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said Gavin, &#8220;she is only taking precautions
against her discovery by the police. You must
remember her part in the riots.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but we never learned how she was able to play
that part. Besides, there is no fear in her, or she would
not have ventured back to Thrums. However, good
luck attend you. But be wary. You saw how she kept
her feet among her shalls and wills? Never trust a
Scotch man or woman who does not come to grief among
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor took his seat in the dogcart.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; he called out, &#8220;that was all
nonsense about the locket.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Chapter Fourteen.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />THE MINISTER DANCES TO THE WOMAN&#8217;S PIPING.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Gavin let the doctor&#8217;s warnings fall in the grass. In
his joy over Nanny&#8217;s deliverance he jumped the garden
gate, whose hinges were of yarn, and cleverly caught
his hat as it was leaving his head in protest. He then
re-entered the mud house staidly. Pleasant was the
change. Nanny&#8217;s home was as a clock that had been
run out, and is set going again. Already the old woman
was unpacking her box, to increase the distance between
herself and the poorhouse. But Gavin only saw her in
the background, for the Egyptian, singing at her work,
had become the heart of the house. She had flung her
shawl over Nanny&#8217;s shoulders, and was at the fireplace
breaking peats with the leg of a stool. She turned
merrily to the minister to ask him to chop up his staff
for firewood, and he would have answered wittily but
could not. Then, as often, the beauty of the Egyptian
surprised him into silence. I could never get used to
her face myself in the after-days. It has always held
me wondering, like my own Glen Quharity on a summer
day, when the sun is lingering and the clouds are
on the march, and the glen is never the same for two
minutes, but always so beautiful as to make me sad.
Never will I attempt to picture the Egyptian as she
seemed to Gavin while she bent over Nanny&#8217;s fire, never
will I describe my glen. Yet a hundred times have I
hankered after trying to picture both.</p>
<p>An older minister, believing that Nanny&#8217;s anguish
was ended, might have gone on his knees and finished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
the interrupted prayer, but now Gavin was only doing
this girl&#8217;s bidding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanny and I are to have a dish of tea, as soon as we
have set things to rights,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;Do you think
we should invite the minister, Nanny?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldna dare,&#8221; Nanny answered quickly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll excuse her, Mr. Dishart, for the presumption?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Presumption!&#8221; said the Egyptian, making a face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lassie,&#8221; Nanny said, fearful to offend her new
friend, yet horrified at this affront to the minister, &#8220;I
ken you mean weel, but Mr. Dishart&#8217;ll think you&#8217;re
putting yoursel&#8217; on an equality wi&#8217; him.&#8221; She added
in a whisper, &#8220;Dinna be so free; he&#8217;s the Auld Licht
minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gypsy bowed with mock awe, but Gavin let it
pass. He had, indeed, forgotten that he was anybody
in particular, and was anxious to stay to tea.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is no water,&#8221; he remembered, &#8220;and is
there any tea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going out for them and for some other things,&#8221;
the Egyptian explained. &#8220;But no,&#8221; she continued, reflectively,
&#8220;if I go for the tea, you must go for the
water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lassie,&#8221; cried Nanny, &#8220;mind wha you&#8217;re speaking
to. To send a minister to the well!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go,&#8221; said Gavin, recklessly lifting the pitcher.
&#8220;The well is in the wood, I think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gie me the pitcher, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; said Nanny, in
distress. &#8220;What a town there would be if you was
seen wi&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he must remain here and keep the house till
we come back,&#8221; said the Egyptian, and thereupon
departed, with a friendly wave of her hand to the
minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an awfu&#8217; lassie,&#8221; Nanny said, apologetically,
&#8220;but it&#8217;ll just be the way she has been brought up.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD INVITE THE MINISTER, NANNY?&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;She has been very good to you, Nanny.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She has; leastwise, she promises to be. Mr. Dishart,
she&#8217;s awa&#8217;; what if she doesna come back?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanny spoke nervously, and Gavin drew a long face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she will,&#8221; he said faintly. &#8220;I am confident
of it,&#8221; he added in the same voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;And has she the siller?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe in her,&#8221; said Gavin, so doggedly that his
own words reassured him. &#8220;She has an excellent
heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said Nanny, to whom the minister&#8217;s faith was
more than the Egyptian&#8217;s promise, &#8220;and that&#8217;s hardly
natural in a gaen-aboot body. Yet a gypsy she maun
be, for naebody would pretend to be ane that wasna.
Tod, she proved she was an Egyptian by dauring to
send you to the well.&#8221;</p>
<p>This conclusive argument brought her prospective
dower so close to Nanny&#8217;s eyes that it hid the poorhouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose she&#8217;ll gie you the money,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
syne you&#8217;ll gie me the seven shillings a week?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That seems the best plan,&#8221; Gavin answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what will you gie it me in?&#8221; Nanny asked, with
something on her mind. &#8220;I would be terrible obliged
if you gae it to me in saxpences.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do the smaller coins go farther?&#8221; Gavin asked,
curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, it&#8217;s no that. But I&#8217;ve heard tell o&#8217; folk giving
away half-crowns by mistake for twa-shilling bits; ay,
and there&#8217;s something dizzying in ha&#8217;en fower-and-twenty
pennies in one piece; it has sic terrible little
bulk. Sanders had aince a gold sovereign, and he
looked at it so often that it seemed to grow smaller and
smaller in his hand till he was feared it micht just be a
half after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mind relieved on this matter, the old woman set
off for the well. A minute afterwards Gavin went to
the door to look for the gypsy, and, behold, Nanny was
no further than the gate. Have you who read ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
been sick near to death, and then so far recovered that
you could once again stand at your window? If so, you
have not forgotten how the beauty of the world struck
you afresh, so that you looked long and said many
times, &#8220;How fair a world it is!&#8221; like one who had
made a discovery. It was such a look that Nanny gave
to the hill and Caddam while she stood at her garden
gate.</p>
<p>Gavin returned to the fire and watched a girl in it
in an officer&#8217;s cloak playing at hide and seek with soldiers.
After a time he sighed, then looked round
sharply to see who had sighed, then, absent-mindedly,
lifted the empty kettle and placed it on the glowing
peats. He was standing glaring at the kettle, his arms
folded, when Nanny returned from the well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking,&#8221; she said, &#8220;o&#8217; something that
proves the lassie to be just an Egyptian. Ay, I noticed
she wasna nane awed when I said you was the Auld
Licht minister. Weel, I&#8217;se uphaud that came frae her
living ower muckle in the open air. Is there no&#8217; a
smell o&#8217; burning in the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have noticed it,&#8221; Gavin answered, sniffing, &#8220;since
you came in. I was busy until then, putting on the
kettle. The smell is becoming worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanny had seen the empty kettle on the fire as he
began to speak, and so solved the mystery. Her first
thought was to snatch the kettle out of the blaze, but
remembering who had put it there, she dared not. She
sidled toward the hearth instead, and saying craftily,
&#8220;Ay, here it is; it&#8217;s a clout among the peats,&#8221; softly
laid the kettle on the earthen floor. It was still red
with sparks, however, when the gypsy reappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who burned the kettle?&#8221; she asked, ignoring
Nanny&#8217;s signs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lassie,&#8221; Nanny said, &#8220;it was me;&#8221; but Gavin, flushing,
confessed his guilt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you stupid!&#8221; exclaimed the Egyptian, shaking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
her two ounces of tea (which then cost six shillings the
pound) in his face.</p>
<p>At this Nanny wrung her hands, crying, &#8220;That&#8217;s
waur than swearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If men,&#8221; said the gypsy, severely, &#8220;would keep
their hands in their pockets all day, the world&#8217;s affairs
would be more easily managed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wheesht!&#8221; cried Nanny, &#8220;if Mr. Dishart cared to
set his mind to it, he could make the kettle boil quicker
than you or me. But his thochts is on higher things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No higher than this,&#8221; retorted the gypsy, holding
her hand level with her brow. &#8220;Confess, Mr. Dishart,
that this is the exact height of what you were thinking
about. See, Nanny, he is blushing as if I meant that
he had been thinking about me. He cannot answer,
Nanny: we have found him out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And kindly of him it is no to answer,&#8221; said Nanny,
who had been examining the gypsy&#8217;s various purchases;
&#8220;for what could he answer, except that he would need
to be sure o&#8217; living a thousand years afore he could
spare five minutes on you or me? Of course it would
be different if we sat under him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; said the Egyptian, with great solemnity,
&#8220;he is to drink tea at that very table. I hope you are
sensible of the honour, Nanny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I no?&#8221; said Nanny, whose education had not
included sarcasm. &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to keep frae thinking
o&#8217;t till he&#8217;s gone, in case I should let the teapot fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have nothing to thank me for, Nanny,&#8221; said
Gavin, &#8220;but much for which to thank this&mdash;this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This haggarty-taggarty Egyptian,&#8221; suggested the
girl. Then, looking at Gavin curiously, she said, &#8220;But
my name is Babbie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s short for Barbara,&#8221; said Nanny; &#8220;but Babbie
what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Babbie Watt,&#8221; replied the gypsy, as if one
name were as good as another.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Weel, then, lift the lid off the kettle, Babbie,&#8221; said
Nanny, &#8220;for it&#8217;s boiling ower.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin looked at Nanny with admiration and envy,
for she had said Babbie as coolly as if it was the name
of a pepper-box.</p>
<p>Babbie tucked up her sleeves to wash Nanny&#8217;s cups
and saucers, which even in the most prosperous days of
the mud house had only been in use once a week, and
Gavin was so eager to help that he bumped his head on
the plate-rack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit there,&#8221; said Babbie, authoritatively, pointing,
with a cup in her hand, to a stool, &#8220;and don&#8217;t rise till I
give you permission.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Nanny&#8217;s amazement, he did as he was bid.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got the things in the little shop you told me of,&#8221;
the Egyptian continued, addressing the mistress of the
house, &#8220;but the horrid man would not give them to me
until he had seen my money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enoch would be suspicious o&#8217; you,&#8221; Nanny explained,
&#8220;you being an Egyptian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Babbie, with a side-glance at the minister,
&#8220;I am only an Egyptian. Is that why you dislike
me, Mr. Dishart?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin hesitated foolishly over his answer, and the
Egyptian, with a towel round her waist, made a pretty
gesture of despair.</p>
<p>&#8220;He neither likes you nor dislikes you,&#8221; Nanny explained;
&#8220;you forget he&#8217;s a minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what I cannot endure,&#8221; said Babbie, putting
the towel to her eyes, &#8220;to be neither liked nor disliked.
Please hate me, Mr. Dishart, if you cannot lo&mdash;ove
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face was behind the towel, and Gavin could not
decide whether it was the face or the towel that shook
with agitation. He gave Nanny a look that asked,
&#8220;Is she really crying?&#8221; and Nanny telegraphed back,
&#8220;I question it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Come, come,&#8221; said the minister, gallantly, &#8220;I did
not say that I disliked you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even this desperate compliment had not the desired
effect, for the gypsy continued to sob behind her screen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can honestly say,&#8221; went on Gavin, as solemnly as
if he were making a statement in a court of justice,
&#8220;that I like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the Egyptian let drop her towel, and replied
with equal solemnity:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, tank oo! Nanny, the minister says me is a dood
&#8217;ittle dirl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didna gang that length,&#8221; said Nanny, sharply,
to cover Gavin&#8217;s confusion. &#8220;Set the things, Babbie,
and I&#8217;ll make the tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Egyptian obeyed demurely, pretending to wipe
her eyes every time Gavin looked at her. He frowned
at this, and then she affected to be too overcome to go
on with her work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, Nanny,&#8221; she asked presently, &#8220;what sort
of man this Enoch is, from whom I bought the things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not very regular, I fear,&#8221; answered Gavin,
who felt that he had sat silent and self-conscious on his
stool too long.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that he drinks?&#8221; asked Babbie.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I mean regular in his attendance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Egyptian&#8217;s face showed no enlightenment.</p>
<p>&#8220;His attendance at church,&#8221; Gavin explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s far frae it,&#8221; said Nanny, &#8220;and as a body kens,
Joe Cruickshanks, the atheist, has the wite o&#8217; that.
The scoundrel telled Enoch that the great ministers in
Edinbury and London believed in no hell except sic as
your ain conscience made for you, and ever since syne
Enoch has been careless about the future state.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Babbie, waving the Church aside, &#8220;what
I want to know is whether he is a single man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not,&#8221; Gavin replied; &#8220;but why do you want
to know that?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Because single men are such gossips. I am sorry
he is not single, as I want him to repeat to everybody
what I told him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust him to tell Susy,&#8221; said Nanny, &#8220;and Susy to
tell the town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His wife is a gossip?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, she&#8217;s aye tonguing, especially about her teeth.
They&#8217;re folk wi&#8217; siller, and she has a set o&#8217; false teeth.
It&#8217;s fair scumfishing to hear her blawing about thae
teeth, she&#8217;s so fleid we dinna ken that they&#8217;re
false.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanny had spoken jealously, but suddenly she trembled
with apprehension.</p>
<p>&#8220;Babbie,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you didna speak about the
poorhouse to Enoch?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Egyptian shook her head, though of the poorhouse
she had been forced to speak, for Enoch, having
seen the doctor going home alone, insisted on knowing
why.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I knew,&#8221; the gypsy said, &#8220;that the Thrums
people would be very unhappy until they discovered
where you get the money I am to give you, and as that
is a secret, I hinted to Enoch that your benefactor is
Mr. Dishart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should not have said that,&#8221; interposed Gavin.
&#8220;I cannot foster such a deception.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will foster it without your help,&#8221; the Egyptian
said. &#8220;Besides, if you choose, you can say you
get the money from a friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, you can say that,&#8221; Nanny entreated with such
eagerness that Babbie remarked a little bitterly:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no fear of Nanny&#8217;s telling any one that the
friend is a gypsy girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, na,&#8221; agreed Nanny, again losing Babbie&#8217;s sarcasm.
&#8220;I winna let on. It&#8217;s so queer to be befriended
by an Egyptian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is scarcely respectable,&#8221; Babbie said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no,&#8221; answered simple Nanny.</p>
<p>I suppose Nanny&#8217;s unintentional cruelty did hurt
Babbie as much as Gavin thought. She winced, and
her face had two expressions, the one cynical, the other
pained. Her mouth curled as if to tell the minister
that gratitude was nothing to her, but her eyes had to
struggle to keep back a tear. Gavin was touched, and
she saw it, and for a moment they were two people who
understood each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I, at least,&#8221; Gavin said in a low voice, &#8220;will know
who is the benefactress, and think none the worse of
her because she is a gypsy.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this Babbie smiled gratefully to him, and then
both laughed, for they had heard Nanny remarking to
the kettle, &#8220;But I wouldna hae been nane angry if she
had telled Enoch that the minister was to take his tea
here. Susy&#8217;ll no believe&#8217;t though I tell her, as tell her
I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Nanny the table now presented a rich appearance,
for besides the teapot there were butter and loaf-bread
and cheesies: a biscuit of which only Thrums knows
the secret.</p>
<p>&#8220;Draw in your chair, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; she said, in suppressed
excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Babbie, &#8220;you take this chair, Mr. Dishart,
and Nanny will have that one, and I can sit
humbly on the stool.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Nanny held up her hands in horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep us a&#8217;!&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;the lassie thinks her
and me is to sit down wi&#8217; the minister! We&#8217;re no to
gang that length, Babbie; we&#8217;re just to stand and
serve him, and syne we&#8217;ll sit down when he has
risen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Delightful!&#8221; said Babbie, clapping her hands.
&#8220;Nanny, you kneel on that side of him, and I will
kneel on this. You will hold the butter and I the
biscuits.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>But Gavin, as this girl was always forgetting, was a
lord of creation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down both of you at once!&#8221; he thundered, &#8220;I
command you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the two women fell into their seats; Nanny in
terror, Babbie affecting it.</p>

<h2>Chapter Fifteen.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />THE MINISTER BEWITCHED&mdash;SECOND SERMON AGAINST WOMEN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>To Nanny it was a dizzying experience to sit at the
head of her own table, and, with assumed calmness, invite
the minister not to spare the loaf-bread. Babbie&#8217;s
prattle, and even Gavin&#8217;s answers, were but an indistinct
noise to her, to be as little regarded, in the
excitement of watching whether Mr. Dishart noticed
that there was a knife for the butter, as the music of the
river by a man who is catching trout. Every time
Gavin&#8217;s cup went to his lips Nanny calculated (correctly)
how much he had drunk, and yet, when the
right moment arrived, she asked in the English voice
that is fashionable at ceremonies, &#8220;if his cup was toom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was well that Nanny had these matters to
engross her, for though Gavin spoke freely, he was saying
nothing of lasting value, and some of his remarks
to the Egyptian, if preserved for the calmer contemplation
of the morrow, might have seemed frivolous to
himself. Usually his observations were scrambled for,
like ha&#8217;pence at a wedding, but to-day they were only
for one person. Infected by the Egyptian&#8217;s high spirits,
Gavin had laid aside the minister with his hat, and what
was left was only a young man. He who had stamped
his feet at thought of a soldier&#8217;s cloak now wanted to
be reminded of it. The little minister, who used to
address himself in terms of scorn every time he wasted
an hour, was at present dallying with a teaspoon. He
even laughed boisterously, flinging back his head, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
little knew that behind Nanny&#8217;s smiling face was a
terrible dread, because his chair had once given way
before.</p>
<p>Even though our thoughts are not with our company,
the mention of our name is a bell to which we usually
answer. Hearing hers Nanny started.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can tell me, Nanny,&#8221; the Egyptian had said,
with an arch look at the minister. &#8220;Oh, Nanny, for
shame! How can you expect to follow our conversation
when you only listen to Mr. Dishart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is saying, Nanny,&#8221; Gavin broke in, almost gaily
for a minister, &#8220;that she saw me recently wearing a
cloak. You know I have no such thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na,&#8221; Nanny answered artlessly, &#8220;you have just the
thin brown coat wi&#8217; the braid round it, forby the ane
you have on the now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; Gavin said to Babbie, &#8220;I could not have
a new neckcloth, not to speak of a cloak, without everybody
in Thrums knowing about it. I dare say Nanny
knows all about the braid, and even what it cost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three bawbees the yard at Kyowowy&#8217;s shop,&#8221; replied
Nanny, promptly, &#8220;and your mother sewed it on.
Sam&#8217;l Fairweather has the marrows o&#8217;t on his top coat.
No that it has the same look on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; Babbie persisted, &#8220;I am sure the
minister has a cloak; but perhaps he is ashamed of it.
No doubt it is hidden away in the garret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, we would hae kent o&#8217;t if it was there,&#8221; said
Nanny.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it may be in a chest, and the chest may be
locked,&#8221; the Egyptian suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but the kist in the garret isna locked,&#8221; Nanny
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you get to know all these things, Nanny?&#8221;
asked Gavin, sighing.</p>

&#8220;&#8216;HE ISN&#8217;T MARRIED?&#8217; ASKED BABBIE.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Your congregation tells me. Naebody would lay
by news about a minister.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But how do they know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna ken. They just find out, because they&#8217;re so
fond o&#8217; you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope they will never become so fond of me as
that,&#8221; said Babbie. &#8220;Still, Nanny, the minister&#8217;s cloak
is hidden somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Losh, what would make him hod it?&#8221; demanded the
old woman. &#8220;Folk that has cloaks doesna bury them
in boxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the word &#8220;bury&#8221; Gavin&#8217;s hand fell on the table,
and he returned to Nanny apprehensively.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would depend on how the cloak was got,&#8221; said
the cruel Egyptian. &#8220;If it was not his own&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lassie,&#8221; cried Nanny, &#8220;behave yoursel&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or if he found it in his possession against his will?&#8221;
suggested Gavin, slyly. &#8220;He might have got it from
some one who picked it up cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From his wife, for instance,&#8221; said Babbie, whereupon
Gavin suddenly became interested in the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, ay, the minister was hitting at you there, Babbie,&#8221;
Nanny explained, &#8220;for the way you made off wi&#8217;
the captain&#8217;s cloak. The Thrums folk wondered less
at your taking it than at your no keeping it. It&#8217;s said
to be michty grand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was rather like the one the minister&#8217;s wife gave
him,&#8221; said Babbie.</p>
<p>&#8220;The minister has neither a wife nor a cloak,&#8221; retorted
Nanny.</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t married?&#8221; asked Babbie, the picture of
incredulity.</p>
<p>Nanny gathered from the minister&#8217;s face that he deputed
to her the task of enlightening this ignorant girl,
so she replied with emphasis, &#8220;Na, they hinna got him
yet, and I&#8217;m cheated if it doesna tak them all their time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus do the best of women sell their sex for nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did wonder,&#8221; said the Egyptian, gravely, &#8220;at any
mere woman&#8217;s daring to marry such a minister.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; replied Nanny, spiritedly, &#8220;but there&#8217;s dauring
limmers wherever there&#8217;s a single man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I have often suspected,&#8221; said Babbie, duly
shocked. &#8220;But, Nanny, I was told the minister had a
wife, by one who said he saw her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He lied, then,&#8221; answered Nanny turning to Gavin
for further instructions.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, see, the minister does not deny the horrid
charge himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, and for the reason he didna deny the cloak: because
it&#8217;s no worth his while. I&#8217;ll tell you wha your
friend had seen. It would be somebody that would like
to be Mrs. Dishart. There&#8217;s a hantle o&#8217; that kind. Ay,
lassie, but wishing winna land a woman in a manse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was one of the soldiers,&#8221; Babbie said, &#8220;who told me
about her. He said Mr. Dishart introduced her to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sojers!&#8221; cried Nanny. &#8220;I could never thole the
name o&#8217; them. Sanders in his young days hankered
after joining them, and so he would, if it hadna been
for the fechting. Ay, and now they&#8217;ve ta&#8217;en him awa
to the gaol, and sworn lies about him. Dinna put any
faith in sojers, lassie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was told,&#8221; Babbie went on, &#8220;that the minister&#8217;s
wife was rather like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaven forbid!&#8221; ejaculated Nanny, so fervently
that all three suddenly sat back from the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no meaning,&#8221; Nanny continued hurriedly, fearing
to offend her benefactress, &#8220;but what you&#8217;re the
bonniest tid I ever saw out o&#8217; an almanack. But you
would ken Mr. Dishart&#8217;s contempt for bonny faces if
you had heard his sermon against them. I didna hear
it mysel&#8217;, for I&#8217;m no Auld Licht, but it did the work o&#8217;
the town for an aucht days.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Nanny had not taken her eyes off Gavin for the
moment she would have known that he was now anxious
to change the topic. Babbie saw it, and became
suspicious.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>&#8220;When did he preach against the wiles of women,
Nanny?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was long ago,&#8221; said Gavin, hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;No so very lang syne,&#8221; corrected Nanny. &#8220;It was
the Sabbath after the sojers was in Thrums; the day
you changed your text so hurriedly. Some thocht you
wasna weel, but Lang Tammas&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thomas Whamond is too officious,&#8221; Gavin said with
dignity. &#8220;I forbid you, Nanny, to repeat his story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what made you change your text?&#8221; asked
Babbie.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see he winna tell,&#8221; Nanny said, wistfully.
&#8220;Ay, I dinna deny but what I would like richt to ken.
But the session&#8217;s as puzzled as yoursel&#8217;, Babbie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps more puzzled,&#8221; answered the Egyptian,
with a smile that challenged Gavin&#8217;s frowns to combat
and overthrow them. &#8220;What surprises me, Mr. Dishart,
is that such a great man can stoop to see whether women
are pretty or not. It was very good of you to remember
me to-day. I suppose you recognized me by my frock?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By your face,&#8221; he replied, boldly; &#8220;by your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanny,&#8221; exclaimed the Egyptian, &#8220;did you hear
what the minister said?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Woe is me,&#8221; answered Nanny, &#8220;I missed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He says he would know me anywhere by my eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So would I mysel&#8217;,&#8221; said Nanny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what colour are they, Mr. Dishart?&#8221; demanded
Babbie. &#8220;Don&#8217;t speak, Nanny, for I want to expose
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She closed her eyes tightly. Gavin was in a quandary.
I suppose he had looked at her eyes too long to
know much about them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blue,&#8221; he guessed at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, they&#8217;re black,&#8221; said Nanny, who had doubtless
known this for an hour. I am always marvelling
over the cleverness of women, as every one must see
who reads this story.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No but what they micht be blue in some lichts,&#8221;
Nanny added, out of respect to the minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t defend him, Nanny,&#8221; said Babbie, looking
reproachfully at Gavin. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see that any minister
has a right to denounce women when he is so ignorant
of his subject. I will say it, Nanny, and you need not
kick me beneath the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>Was not all this intoxicating to the little minister,
who had never till now met a girl on equal terms? At
twenty-one a man is a musical instrument given to the
other sex, but it is not as instruments learned at school,
for when She sits down to it she cannot tell what tune
she is about to play. That is because she has no notion
of what the instrument is capable. Babbie&#8217;s kind-heartedness,
her gaiety, her coquetry, her moments of
sadness, had been a witch&#8217;s fingers, and Gavin was still
trembling under their touch. Even in being taken to
task by her there was a charm, for every pout of her
mouth, every shake of her head, said, &#8220;You like me,
and therefore you have given me the right to tease
you.&#8221; Men sign these agreements without reading
them. But, indeed, man is a stupid animal at the best,
and thinks all his life that he did not propose until he
blurted out, &#8220;I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was later than it should have been when the
minister left the mud house, and even then he only put
on his hat because Babbie said that she must go.</p>
<p>&#8220;But not your way,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I go into the wood
and vanish. You know, Nanny, I live up a tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinna say that,&#8221; said Nanny, anxiously, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll be
fleid about the siller.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fear about it. Mr. Dishart will get some of
it to-morrow at the Kaims. I would bring it here, but
I cannot come so far to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;I HAVE READ MY FORTUNE.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll hae peace to the end o&#8217; my days,&#8221; said the
old woman, &#8220;and, Babbie, I wish the same to you wi&#8217;
all my heart.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; Babbie replied, mournfully, &#8220;I have read my
fortune, Nanny, and there is not much happiness in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope that is not true,&#8221; Gavin said, simply.</p>
<p>They were standing at the door, and she was looking
toward the hill, perhaps without seeing it. All at once
it came to Gavin that this fragile girl might have a
history far sadder and more turbulent than his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really care?&#8221; she asked, without looking at
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said stoutly, &#8220;I care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you do not know me,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I do know you,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>Now she did look at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; she said, making a discovery, &#8220;that you
misunderstand me less than those who have known me
longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a perilous confidence, for it at once made
Gavin say &#8220;Babbie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she answered, frankly, &#8220;I am glad to hear that.
I thought you did not really like me, because you never
called me by my name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin drew a great breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was not the reason,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The reason was now unmistakable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wrong,&#8221; said the Egyptian, a little alarmed;
&#8220;you do not understand me at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She returned to Nanny, and Gavin set off, holding
his head high, his brain in a whirl. Five minutes afterwards,
when Nanny was at the fire, the diamond ring
on her little finger, he came back, looking like one who
had just seen sudden death.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had forgotten,&#8221; he said, with a fierceness aimed at
himself, &#8220;that to-morrow is the Sabbath.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Need that make any difference?&#8221; asked the gypsy.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this hour on Monday,&#8221; said Gavin, hoarsely,
&#8220;I will be at the Kaims.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went away without another word, and Babbie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
watched him from the window. Nanny had not looked
up from the ring.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a pity he is a minister!&#8221; the girl said, reflectively.
&#8220;Nanny, you are not listening.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old woman was making the ring flash by the
light of the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanny, do you hear me? Did you see Mr. Dishart
come back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard the door open,&#8221; Nanny answered, without
taking her greedy eyes off the ring. &#8220;Was it him?
Whaur did you get this, lassie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it me back, Nanny, I am going now.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Nanny did not give it back; she put her other
hand over it to guard it, and there she crouched, warming
herself not at the fire, but at the ring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it me, Nanny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It winna come off my finger.&#8221; She gloated over it,
nursed it, kissed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must have it, Nanny.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Egyptian put her hand lightly on the old woman&#8217;s
shoulder, and Nanny jumped up, pressing the ring to
her bosom. Her face had become cunning and ugly;
she retreated into a corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanny, give me back my ring or I will take it from
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cruel light of the diamond was in Nanny&#8217;s eyes
for a moment, and then, shuddering, she said, &#8220;Tak
your ring awa, tak it out o&#8217; my sicht.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime Gavin was trudging home gloomily
composing his second sermon against women. I have
already given the entry in my own diary for that day:
this is his:&mdash;&#8220;Notes on Jonah. Exchanged vol. xliii.,
&#8216;European Magazine,&#8217; for Owen&#8217;s &#8216;Justification&#8217; (<i>per</i>

Nanny Webster.&#8221; There is no mention of the Egyptian.</p>

<h2>Chapter Sixteen.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />CONTINUED MISBEHAVIOUR OF THE EGYPTIAN WOMAN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>By the following Monday it was known at many
looms that something sat heavily on the Auld Licht
minister&#8217;s mind. On the previous day he had preached
his second sermon of warning to susceptible young men,
and his first mention of the word &#8220;woman&#8221; had blown
even the sleepy heads upright. Now he had salt fish
for breakfast, and on clearing the table Jean noticed
that his knife and fork were uncrossed. He was observed
walking into a gooseberry bush by Susy Linn, who
possessed the pioneer spring-bed of Thrums, and always
knew when her man jumped into it by suddenly finding
herself shot to the ceiling. Lunan, the tinsmith, and
two women, who had the luck to be in the street at the
time, saw him stopping at Dr. McQueen&#8217;s door, as if
about to knock, and then turning smartly away. His
hat blew off in the school wynd, where a wind wanders
ever, looking for hats, and he chased it so passionately
that Lang Tammas went into Allardyce&#8217;s smiddy to
say&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna like it. Of course he couldna afford to lose
his hat, but he should hae run after it mair reverently.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin, indeed, was troubled. He had avoided speaking
of the Egyptian to his mother. He had gone to
McQueen&#8217;s house to ask the doctor to accompany him
to the Kaims, but with the knocker in his hand he
changed his mind, and now he was at the place of meeting
alone. It was a day of thaw, nothing to be heard
from a distance but the swish of curling-stones through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
water on Rashie-bog, where the match for the eldership
was going on. Around him, Gavin saw only dejected
firs with drops of water falling listlessly from them,
clods of snow, and grass that rustled as if animals were
crawling through it. All the roads were slack.</p>
<p>I suppose no young man to whom society has not
become a cheap thing can be in Gavin&#8217;s position, awaiting
the coming of an attractive girl, without giving
thought to what he should say to her. When in the
pulpit or visiting the sick, words came in a rush to the
little minister, but he had to set his teeth to determine
what to say to the Egyptian.</p>
<p>This was because he had not yet decided which of
two women she was. Hardly had he started on one line
of thought when she crossed his vision in a new light,
and drew him after her.</p>
<p>Her &#8220;Need that make any difference?&#8221; sang in his ear
like another divit, cast this time at religion itself, and
now he spoke aloud, pointing his finger at a fir: &#8220;I said
at the mud house that I believed you because I knew
you. To my shame be it said that I spoke falsely. How
dared you bewitch me? In your presence I flung away
the precious hours in frivolity; I even forgot the Sabbath.
For this I have myself to blame. I am an unworthy
preacher of the Word. I sinned far more than
you who have been brought up godlessly from your
cradle. Nevertheless, whoever you are, I call upon
you, before we part never to meet again, to repent of
your&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>And then it was no mocker of the Sabbath he was
addressing, but a woman with a child&#8217;s face, and there
were tears in her eyes. &#8220;Do you care?&#8221; she was saying,
and again he answered, &#8220;Yes, I care.&#8221; This girl&#8217;s
name was not Woman, but Babbie.</p>
<p>Now Gavin made an heroic attempt to look upon both
these women at once. &#8220;Yes, I believe in you,&#8221; he said
to them, &#8220;but henceforth you must send your money to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
Nanny by another messenger. You are a gypsy and I
am a minister; and that must part us. I refuse to see
you again. I am not angry with you, but as a minister&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not the disappearance of one of the women
that clipped this argument short; it was Babbie singing&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;It fell on a day, on a bonny summer day,</p>
<p class='indent2'>When the corn grew green and yellow,</p>
<p>That there fell out a great dispute</p>
<p class='indent2'>Between Argyle and Airly.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;The Duke of Montrose has written to Argyle</p>
<p class='indent2'>To come in the morning early,</p>
<p>An&#8217; lead in his men by the back o&#8217; Dunkeld</p>
<p class='indent2'>To plunder the bonny house o&#8217; Airly.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;Where are you?&#8221; cried Gavin in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am watching you from my window so high,&#8221;
answered the Egyptian; and then the minister, looking
up, saw her peering at him from a fir.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get up there?&#8221; he asked in amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;On my broomstick,&#8221; Babbie replied, and sang on&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;The lady looked o&#8217;er her window sae high,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And oh! but she looked weary,</p>
<p>And there she espied the great Argyle</p>
<p class='indent2'>Come to plunder the bonny house o&#8217; Airly.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing there?&#8221; Gavin said, wrathfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my home,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I told you I
lived in a tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down at once,&#8221; ordered Gavin. To which the
singer responded&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Come down, come down, Lady Margaret,&#8217; he says;</p>
<p class='indent2'>&#8216;Come down and kiss me fairly</p>
<p>Or before the morning clear day light</p>
<p class='indent2'>I&#8217;ll no leave a standing stane in Airly.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;If you do not come down this instant,&#8221; Gavin said
in a rage, &#8220;and give me what I was so foolish as to
come for, I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>The Egyptian broke in&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I wouldna kiss thee, great Argyle,</p>
<p class='indent2'>I wouldna kiss thee fairly;</p>
<p>I wouldna kiss thee, great Argyle,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Gin you shouldna leave a standing stane in Airly.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;You have deceived Nanny,&#8221; Gavin cried, hotly,
&#8220;and you have brought me here to deride me. I will
have no more to do with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked away quickly, but she called after him,
&#8220;I am coming down. I have the money,&#8221; and next
moment a snowball hit his hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is for being cross,&#8221; she explained, appearing
so unexpectedly at his elbow that he was taken aback.
&#8220;I had to come close up to you before I flung it, or it
would have fallen over my shoulder. Why are you so
nasty to-day? and, oh, do you know you were speaking
to yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mistaken,&#8221; said Gavin, severely. &#8220;I was
speaking to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t see me till I began to sing, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless I was speaking to you, or rather, I was
saying to myself what&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you had decided to say to me?&#8221; said the delighted
gypsy. &#8220;Do you prepare your talk like
sermons? I hope you have prepared something nice for
me. If it is very nice I may give you this bunch of holly.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was dressed as he had seen her previously, but
for a cluster of holly berries at her breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that you will think it nice,&#8221; the minister
answered, slowly, &#8220;but my duty&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is about duty,&#8221; entreated Babbie, &#8220;don&#8217;t say it.
Don&#8217;t, and I will give you the berries.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took the berries from her dress, smiling triumphantly
the while like one who had discovered a cure for
duty; and instead of pointing the finger of wrath at
her, Gavin stood expectant.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But no,&#8221; he said, remembering who he was, and
pushing the gift from him, &#8220;I will not be bribed. I
must tell you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the Egyptian, sadly, &#8220;I see you are
angry with me. Is it because I said I lived in a tree?
Do forgive me for that dreadful lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had gone on her knees before he could stop her,
and was gazing imploringly at him, with her hands
clasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mocking me again,&#8221; said Gavin, &#8220;but I am
not angry with you. Only you must understand&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She jumped up and put her fingers to her ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see I can hear nothing,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen while I tell you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t hear a word. Why do you scold me when I
have kept my promise? If I dared to take my fingers
from my ears I would give you the money for Nanny.
And, Mr. Dishart, I must be gone in five minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In five minutes!&#8221; echoed Gavin, with such a dismal
face that Babbie heard the words with her eyes, and
dropped her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you in such haste?&#8221; he asked, taking the
five pounds mechanically, and forgetting all that he
had meant to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because they require me at home,&#8221; she answered,
with a sly glance at her fir. &#8220;And, remember, when I
run away you must not follow me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Gavin, so promptly that she was
piqued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;But of course you only
came here for the money. Well, you have got it.
Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that was not what I meant,&#8221; said Gavin,
stepping after her. &#8220;I have told you already that whatever
other people say, I trust you. I believe in you,
Babbie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that what you were saying to the tree?&#8221; asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
the Egyptian, demurely. Then, perhaps thinking it
wisest not to press this point, she continued irrelevantly,
&#8220;It seems such a pity that you are a minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A pity to be a minister!&#8221; exclaimed Gavin, indignantly.
&#8220;Why, why, you&mdash;why, Babbie, how have you
been brought up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a curious way,&#8221; Babbie answered, shortly, &#8220;but
I can&#8217;t tell you about that just now. Would you like
to hear all about me?&#8221; Suddenly she seemed to have
become confidential.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really think me a gypsy?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have tried not to ask myself that question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it seems like doubting your word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you can think of me at all without
wondering who I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, and so I try not to think of you at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know that you need do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not quite succeeded.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Egyptian&#8217;s pique had vanished, but she may
have thought that the conversation was becoming dangerous,
for she said abruptly&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I sometimes think about you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you?&#8221; said Gavin, absurdly gratified. &#8220;What
do you think about me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; answered the Egyptian, pleasantly,
&#8220;which of us is the taller.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin&#8217;s fingers twitched with mortification, and not
only his fingers but his toes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us measure,&#8221; she said, sweetly, putting her back
to his. &#8220;You are not stretching your neck, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the minister broke away from her.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one subject,&#8221; he said, with great dignity,
&#8220;that I allow no one to speak of in my presence, and
that is my&mdash;my height.&#8221;</p>
<p>His face was as white as his cravat when the surprised
Egyptian next looked at him, and he was panting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
like one who has run a mile. She was ashamed of herself,
and said so.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a topic I would rather not speak about,&#8221; Gavin
answered, dejectedly, &#8220;especially to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He meant that he would rather be a tall man in her
company than in any other, and possibly she knew this,
though all she answered was&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wanted to know if I am really a gypsy. Well,
I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An ordinary gypsy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think me ordinary?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I knew what to think of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, well, that is my forbidden topic. But we have
a good many ideas in common after all, have we not,
though you are only a minis&mdash;I mean, though I am only
a gypsy?&#8221;</p>
<p>There fell between them a silence that gave Babbie
time to remember she must go.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have already stayed too long,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Give
my love to Nanny, and say that I am coming to see her
soon, perhaps on Monday. I don&#8217;t suppose you will
be there on Monday, Mr. Dishart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I cannot say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you will be too busy. Are you to take the holly
berries?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had better not,&#8221; said Gavin, dolefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if you don&#8217;t want them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give them to me,&#8221; he said, and as he took them his
hand shook.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know why you are looking so troubled,&#8221; said the
Egyptian, archly. &#8220;You think I am to ask you the
colour of my eyes, and you have forgotten again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He would have answered, but she checked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make no pretence,&#8221; she said, severely; &#8220;I know you
think they are blue.&#8221;</p>
<p>She came close to him until her face almost touched
his.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Look hard at them,&#8221; she said, solemnly, &#8220;and after
this you may remember that they are black, black,
black!&#8221;</p>
<p>At each repetition of the word she shook her head in
his face. She was adorable. Gavin&#8217;s arms&mdash;but they
met on nothing. She had run away.</p>
<p>When the little minister had gone, a man came from
behind a tree and shook his fist in the direction taken
by the gypsy. It was Rob Dow, black with passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Egyptian!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You limmer, wha
are you that hae got haud o&#8217; the minister?&#8221;</p>
<p>He pursued her, but she vanished as from Gavin in
Windyghoul.</p>
<p>&#8220;A common Egyptian!&#8221; he muttered when he had
to give up the search. &#8220;But take care, you little devil,&#8221;
he called aloud; &#8220;take care; if I catch you playing
pranks wi&#8217; that man again I&#8217;ll wring your neck like a
hen&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>Margaret having heard the doctor say that one may
catch cold in the back, had decided instantly to line
Gavin&#8217;s waistcoat with flannel. She was thus engaged,
with pins in her mouth and the scissors hiding from her
every time she wanted them, when Jean, red and flurried,
abruptly entered the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;There! I forgot to knock at the door again,&#8221; Jean
exclaimed, pausing contritely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind. Is it Rob Dow wanting the minister?&#8221;
asked Margaret, who had seen Rob pass the manse dyke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, he wasna wanting to see the minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, then, he came to see you, Jean,&#8221; said Margaret,
archly.</p>
<p>&#8220;A widow man!&#8221; cried Jean, tossing her head. &#8220;But
Rob Dow was in no condition to be friendly wi&#8217; onybody
the now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean, you don&#8217;t mean that he has been drinking
again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I canna say he was drunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what condition was he in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was in a&mdash;a swearing condition,&#8221; Jean answered,
guardedly. &#8220;But what I want to speir at you is, can I
gang down to the Tenements for a minute? I&#8217;ll run
there and back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly you can go, Jean, but you must not run.
You are always running. Did Dow bring you word
that you were wanted in the Tenements?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No exactly, but I&mdash;I want to consult Tammas Haggart
about&mdash;about something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About Dow, I believe, Jean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, but about something he has done. Oh, ma&#8217;am,
you surely dinna think I would take a widow man?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the day after Gavin&#8217;s meeting with the Egyptian
at the Kaims, and here is Jean&#8217;s real reason for
wishing to consult Haggart. Half an hour before she
hurried to the parlour she had been at the kitchen door
wondering whether she should spread out her washing
in the garret or risk hanging it in the courtyard. She
had just decided on the garret when she saw Rob Dow
morosely regarding her from the gateway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whaur is he?&#8221; growled Rob.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s out, but it&#8217;s no for me to say whaur he is,&#8221;
replied Jean, whose weakness was to be considered a
church official. &#8220;No that I ken,&#8221; truthfulness compelled
her to add, for she had an ambition to be
everything she thought Gavin would like a woman
to be.</p>
<p>Rob seized her wrists viciously and glowered into her
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re ane o&#8217; them,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go. Ane o&#8217; what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ane o&#8217; thae limmers called women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sal,&#8221; retorted Jean with spirit, &#8220;you&#8217;re ane o&#8217; thae
brutes called men. You&#8217;re drunk, Rob Dow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the legs maybe, but no higher. I haud a heap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Drunk again, after all your promises to the minister!
And you said yoursel&#8217; that he had pulled you out o&#8217; hell
by the root.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s himsel&#8217; that has flung me back again,&#8221; Rob
said, wildly. &#8220;Jean Baxter, what does it mean when a
minister carries flowers in his pouch; ay, and takes
them out to look at them ilka minute?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you ken about the holly?&#8221; asked Jean, off
her guard.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You limmer,&#8221; said Dow, &#8220;you&#8217;ve been in his
pouches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lie!&#8221; cried the outraged Jean. &#8220;I just saw
the holly this morning in a jug on his chimley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Carefully put by? Is it hod on the chimley? Does
he stand looking at it? Do you tell me he&#8217;s fond-like
o&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy me!&#8221; Jean exclaimed, beginning to shake;
&#8220;wha is she, Rob Dow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see it first in its jug,&#8221; Rob answered, slyly,
&#8220;and syne I may tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was not the only time Jean had been asked to
show the minister&#8217;s belongings. Snecky Hobart, among
others, had tried on Gavin&#8217;s hat in the manse kitchen,
and felt queer for some time afterwards. Women had
been introduced on tiptoe to examine the handle of his
umbrella. But Rob had not come to admire. He
snatched the holly from Jean&#8217;s hands, and casting it on
the ground pounded it with his heavy boots, crying,
&#8220;Greet as you like, Jean. That&#8217;s the end o&#8217; his flowers,
and if I had the tawpie he got them frae I would serve
her in the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell him what you&#8217;ve done,&#8221; said terrified Jean,
who had tried to save the berries at the expense of her
fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him,&#8221; Dow roared; &#8220;and tell him what I said
too. Ay, and tell him I was at the Kaims yestreen.
Tell him I&#8217;m hunting high and low for an Egyptian
woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>He flung recklessly out of the courtyard, leaving
Jean looking blankly at the mud that had been holly
lately. Not his act of sacrilege was distressing her,
but his news. Were these berries a love token? Had
God let Rob Dow say they were a gypsy&#8217;s love token,
and not slain him?</p>
<p>That Rob spoke of the Egyptian of the riots Jean
never doubted. It was known that the minister had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
met this woman in Nanny Webster&#8217;s house, but was it
not also known that he had given her such a talking-to
as she could never come above? Many could repeat the
words in which he had announced to Nanny that his
wealthy friends in Glasgow were to give her all she
needed. They could also tell how majestic he looked
when he turned the Egyptian out of the house. In
short, Nanny having kept her promise of secrecy, the
people had been forced to construct the scene in the
mud house for themselves, and it was only their story
that was known to Jean.</p>
<p>She decided that, so far as the gypsy was concerned,
Rob had talked trash. He had seen the holly in the
minister&#8217;s hand, and, being in drink, had mixed it up
with the gossip about the Egyptian. But that Gavin
had preserved the holly because of the donor was as
obvious to Jean as that the vase in her hand was empty.
Who could she be? No doubt all the single ladies in
Thrums were in love with him, but that, Jean was sure,
had not helped them a step forward.</p>
<p>To think was to Jean a waste of time. Discovering
that she had been thinking, she was dismayed. There
were the wet clothes in the basket looking reproachfully
at her. She hastened back to Gavin&#8217;s room with the
vase, but it too had eyes, and they said, &#8220;When the
minister misses his holly he will question you.&#8221; Now
Gavin had already smiled several times to Jean, and
once he had marked passages for her in her &#8220;Pilgrim&#8217;s
Progress,&#8221; with the result that she prized the marks
more even than the passages. To lose his good opinion
was terrible to her. In her perplexity she decided to
consult wise Tammas Haggart, and hence her appeal to
Margaret.</p>
<p>To avoid Chirsty, the humourist&#8217;s wife, Jean sought
Haggart at his workshop window, which was so small
that an old book sufficed for its shutter. Haggart,
whom she could see distinctly at his loom, soon guessed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
from her knocks and signs (for he was strangely quick
in the uptake) that she wanted him to open the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to speak to you confidentially,&#8221; Jean said in
a low voice. &#8220;If you saw a grand man gey fond o&#8217; a
flower, what would you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would think, Jean,&#8221; Haggart answered, reflectively,
&#8220;that he had gien siller for&#8217;t; ay, I would
wonder&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you wonder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would wonder how muckle he paid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if he was a&mdash;a minister, and keepit the flower&mdash;say
it was a common rose&mdash;fond-like on his chimley,
what would you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would think it was a black-burning disgrace for a
minister to be fond o&#8217; flowers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna haud wi&#8217; that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean,&#8221; said Haggart, &#8220;I allow no one to contradict
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasna my design. But, Tammas, if a&mdash;a minister
was fond o&#8217; a particular flower&mdash;say a rose&mdash;and you
destroyed it by an accident, when he wasna looking,
what would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would gie him another rose for&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you didna want him to ken you had meddled
wi&#8217;t on his chimley, what would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would put the new rose on the chimley, and he
would never ken the differ.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do,&#8221; muttered Jean, but she said
aloud&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it micht be that particular rose he liked?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Havers, Jean. To a thinking man one rose is
identical wi&#8217; another rose. But how are you speiring?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just out o&#8217; curiosity, and I maun be stepping now.
Thank you kindly, Tammas, for your humour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome,&#8221; Haggart answered, and closed
his window.</p>
<p>That day Rob Dow spent in misery, but so little were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
his fears selfish that he scarcely gave a thought to his
conduct at the manse. For an hour he sat at his loom
with his arms folded. Then he slouched out of the
house, cursing little Micah, so that a neighbour cried
&#8220;You drucken scoundrel!&#8221; after him. &#8220;He may be a
wee drunk,&#8221; said Micah in his father&#8217;s defence, &#8220;but
he&#8217;s no mortal.&#8221; Rob <ins title='Was wondered'>wandered</ins> to the Kaims in search
of the Egyptian, and returned home no happier. He
flung himself upon his bed and dared Micah to light the
lamp. About gloaming he rose, unable to keep his
mouth shut on his thoughts any longer, and staggered
to the Tenements to consult Haggart. He found the
humourist&#8217;s door ajar, and Wearyworld listening at it.
&#8220;Out o&#8217; the road!&#8221; cried Rob, savagely, and flung the
policeman into the gutter.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was ill-dune, Rob Dow,&#8221; Wearyworld said,
picking himself up leisurely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking it was weel-dune,&#8221; snarled Rob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said Wearyworld, &#8220;we needna quarrel about
a difference o&#8217; opeenion; but, Rob&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Dow, however, had already entered the house and
slammed the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, ay,&#8221; muttered Wearyworld, departing, &#8220;you
micht hae stood still, Rob, and argued it out wi&#8217;
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>In less than an hour after his conversation with Jean
at the window it had suddenly struck Haggart that the
minister she spoke of must be Mr. Dishart. In two
hours he had confided his suspicions to Chirsty. In ten
minutes she had filled the house with gossips. Rob
arrived to find them in full cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, Rob,&#8221; said Chirsty, genially, for gossip levels
ranks, &#8220;you&#8217;re just in time to hear a query about the
minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rob,&#8221; said the Glen Quharity post, from whom I
subsequently got the story, &#8220;Mr. Dishart has fallen in&mdash;in&mdash;what
do you call the thing, Chirsty?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>Birse knew well what the thing was called, but the
word is a staggerer to say in company.</p>
<p>&#8220;In love,&#8221; answered Chirsty, boldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we ken what he was doing in the country yestreen,&#8221;
said Snecky Hobart, &#8220;the which has been
bothering us sair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The manse is fu&#8217; o&#8217; the flowers she sends him,&#8221; said
Tibbie Craik. &#8220;Jean&#8217;s at her wits&#8217;-end to ken whaur
to put them a&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Rob Dow who spoke. All saw he had been
drinking, or they might have wondered at his vehemence.
As it was, everybody looked at every other
body, and then everybody sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, wha is she?&#8221; repeated several.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you ken nothing about her,&#8221; said Rob, much
relieved; and he then lapsed into silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ken a&#8217; about her,&#8221; said Snecky, &#8220;except just
wha she is. Ay, that&#8217;s what we canna bottom. Maybe
you could guess, Tammas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I could, Sneck,&#8221; Haggart replied, cautiously;
&#8220;but on that point I offer no opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she bides on the Kaims road,&#8221; said Tibbie Craik,
&#8220;she maun be a farmer&#8217;s dochter. What say you to
Bell Finlay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na; she&#8217;s U. P. But it micht be Loups o&#8217; Malcolm&#8217;s
sister. She&#8217;s promised to Muckle Haws; but
no doubt she would gie him the go-by at a word frae
the minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mair likely,&#8221; said Chirsty, &#8220;to be the factor at
the Spittal&#8217;s lassie. The factor has a grand garden,
and that would account for such basketfuls o&#8217; flowers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whaever she is,&#8221; said Birse, &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking he could
hae done better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be fine pleased wi&#8217; ony o&#8217; them,&#8221; said Tibbie,
who had a magenta silk, and so was jealous of no one.</p>
<p>&#8220;It hasna been proved,&#8221; Haggart pointed out, &#8220;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
the flowers came frae thae parts. She may be sending
them frae Glasgow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I aye understood it was a Glasgow lady,&#8221; said Snecky.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll be like the Tilliedrum minister that got a lady
to send him to the college on the promise that he would
marry her as soon as he got a kirk. She made him sign
a paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The far-seeing limmer,&#8221; exclaimed Chirsty. &#8220;But
if that&#8217;s what Mr. Dishart has done, how has he kept it
so secret?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wouldna want the women o&#8217; the congregation to
ken he was promised till after they had voted for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna haud wi&#8217; that explanation o&#8217;t,&#8221; said Haggart,
&#8220;but I may tell you that I ken for sure she&#8217;s a
Glasgow leddy. Lads, ministers is near aye bespoke
afore they&#8217;re licensed. There&#8217;s a michty competition
for them in the big toons. Ay, the leddies just stand
at the college gates, as you may say, and snap them up
as they come out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And just as well for the ministers, I&#8217;se uphaud,&#8221;
said Tibbie, &#8220;for it saves them a heap o&#8217; persecution
when they come to the like o&#8217; Thrums. There was Mr.
Meiklejohn, the U. P. minister: he was no sooner placed
than every genteel woman in the town was persecuting
him. The Miss Dobies was the maist shameless; they
fair hunted him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said Snecky; &#8220;and in the tail o&#8217; the day ane
o&#8217; them snacked him up. Billies, did you ever hear
o&#8217; a minister being refused?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel, then, I have; and by a widow woman too.
His name was Samson, and if it had been Tamson she
would hae ta&#8217;en him. Ay, you may look, but it&#8217;s true.
Her name was Turnbull, and she had another gent after
her, name o&#8217; Tibbets. She couldna make up her mind
atween them, and for a while she just keeped them dangling
on. Ay, but in the end she took Tibbets. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
what, think you, was her reason? As you ken, thae
grand folk has their initials on their spoons and nichtgowns.
Ay, weel, she thocht it would be mair handy
to take Tibbets, because if she had ta&#8217;en the minister
the <i>T&#8217;s</i> would have had to be changed to <i>S&#8217;s</i>. It was
thoctfu&#8217; o&#8217; her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Tibbets living?&#8221; asked Haggart sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; he&#8217;s dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; asked Haggart, &#8220;was the corp to trade?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna ken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thocht no,&#8221; said Haggart, triumphantly. &#8220;Weel,
I warrant he was a minister too. Ay, catch a woman
giving up a minister, except for another minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>All were looking on Haggart with admiration, when
a voice from the door cried&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, and I&#8217;ll tell you a queerer ane than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dagont,&#8221; cried Birse, &#8220;it&#8217;s Wearywarld, and he has
been hearkening. Leave him to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the post returned, the conversation was back
at Mr. Dishart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, lathies,&#8221; Haggart was saying, &#8220;daftness about
women comes to all, gentle and simple, common and
colleged, humourists and no humourists. You say Mr.
Dishart has preached ower muckle at women to stoop
to marriage, but that makes no differ. Mony a humorous
thing hae I said about women, and yet Chirsty has
me. It&#8217;s the same wi&#8217; ministers. A&#8217; at aince they see
a lassie no&#8217; unlike ither lassies, away goes their learning,
and they skirl out, &#8216;You dawtie!&#8217; That&#8217;s what
comes to all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it hasna come to Mr. Dishart,&#8221; cried Rob Dow,
jumping to his feet. He had sought Haggart to tell
him all, but now he saw the wisdom of telling nothing.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sick o&#8217; your blathers. Instead o&#8217; the minister&#8217;s
being sweethearting yesterday, he was just at the
Kaims visiting the gamekeeper. I met him in the
Wast town-end, and gaed there and back wi&#8217; him.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s proof it&#8217;s a Glasgow leddy,&#8221; said Snecky.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you there&#8217;s no leddy ava!&#8221; swore Rob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yea, and wha sends the baskets o&#8217; flowers, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was only one flower,&#8221; said Rob, turning to
his host.</p>
<p>&#8220;I aye understood,&#8221; said Haggart heavily, &#8220;that
there was only one flower.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But though there was just ane,&#8221; persisted Chirsty,
&#8220;what we want to ken is wha gae him it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was me that gae him it,&#8221; said Rob; &#8220;it was
growing on the roadside, and I plucked it and gae it to
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company dwindled away shamefacedly, yet unconvinced;
but Haggart had courage to say slowly&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Rob, I had aye a notion that he got it frae
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gavin, unaware that talk about him and
a woman unknown had broken out in Thrums, was gazing,
sometimes lovingly and again with scorn, at a little
bunch of holly-berries which Jean had gathered from
her father&#8217;s garden. Once she saw him fling them out
of his window, and then she rejoiced. But an hour
afterwards she saw him pick them up, and then she
mourned. Nevertheless, to her great delight, he
preached his third sermon against Woman on the following
Sabbath. It was universally acknowledged to be
the best of the series. It was also the last.</p>

<h2>Chapter Eighteen.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />CADDAM&mdash;LOVE LEADING TO A RUPTURE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Gavin told himself not to go near the mud house on
the following Monday; but he went. The distance is
half a mile, and the time he took was two hours. This
was owing to his setting out due west to reach a point
due north; yet with the intention of deceiving none
save himself. His reason had warned him to avoid the
Egyptian, and his desires had consented to be dragged
westward because they knew he had started too soon.
When the proper time came they knocked reason on the
head and carried him straight to Caddam. Here reason
came to, and again began to state its case. Desires
permitted him to halt, as if to argue the matter out, but
were thus tolerant merely because from where he stood
he could see Nanny&#8217;s doorway. When Babbie emerged
from it reason seems to have made one final effort, for
Gavin quickly took that side of a tree which is loved of
squirrels at the approach of an enemy. He looked
round the tree-trunk at her, and then reason discarded
him. The gypsy had two empty pans in her hands.
For a second she gazed in the minister&#8217;s direction, then
demurely leaped the ditch of leaves that separated
Nanny&#8217;s yard from Caddam, and strolled into the wood.
Discovering with indignation that he had been skulking
behind the tree, Gavin came into the open. How
good of the Egyptian, he reflected, to go to the well for
water, and thus save the old woman&#8217;s arms! Reason
shouted from near the manse (he only heard the echo)
that he could still make up on it. &#8220;Come along,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
said his desires, and marched him prisoner to the
well.</p>
<p>The path which Babbie took that day is lost in blaeberry
leaves now, and my little maid and I lately
searched for an hour before we found the well. It was
dry, choked with broom and stones, and broken rusty
pans, but we sat down where Babbie and Gavin had
talked, and I stirred up many memories. Probably two
of those pans, that could be broken in the hands to-day
like shortbread, were Nanny&#8217;s, and almost certainly the
stones are fragments from the great slab that used to
cover the well. Children like to peer into wells to see
what the world is like at the other side, and so this
covering was necessary. Rob Angus was the strong
man who bore the stone to Caddam, flinging it a yard
before him at a time. The well had also a wooden lid
with leather hinges, and over this the stone was dragged.</p>
<p>Gavin arrived at the well in time to offer Babbie the
loan of his arms. In her struggle she had taken her
lips into her mouth, but in vain did she tug at the stone,
which refused to do more than turn round on the wood.
But for her presence, the minister&#8217;s efforts would have
been equally futile. Though not strong, however, he
had the national horror of being beaten before a spectator,
and once at school he had won a fight by telling his
big antagonist to come on until the boy was tired of
pummelling him. As he fought with the stone now,
pains shot through his head, and his arms threatened to
come away at the shoulders; but remove it he did.</p>
<p>&#8220;How strong you are!&#8221; Babbie said with open
admiration.</p>
<p>I am sure no words of mine could tell how pleased the
minister was; yet he knew he was not strong, and
might have known that she had seen him do many
things far more worthy of admiration without admiring
them. This, indeed, is a sad truth, that we seldom
give our love to what is worthiest in its object.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How curious that we should have met here,&#8221; Babbie
said, in her dangerously friendly way, as they filled the
pans. &#8220;Do you know I quite started when your shadow
fell suddenly on the stone. Did you happen to be passing
through the wood?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered truthful Gavin, &#8220;I was looking for
you. I thought you saw me from Nanny&#8217;s door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you? I only saw a man hiding behind a tree,
and of course I knew it could not be you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin looked at her sharply, but she was not laughing
at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was I,&#8221; he admitted; &#8220;but I was not exactly hiding
behind the tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had only stepped behind it for a moment,&#8221; suggested
the Egyptian.</p>
<p>Her gravity gave way to laughter under Gavin&#8217;s suspicious
looks, but the laughing ended abruptly. She
had heard a noise in the wood, Gavin heard it too, and
they both turned round in time to see two ragged boys
running from them. When boys are very happy they
think they must be doing wrong, and in a wood, of
which they are among the natural inhabitants, they
always take flight from the enemy, adults, if given time.
For my own part, when I see a boy drop from a tree I
am as little surprised as if he were an apple or a nut.
But Gavin was startled, picturing these spies handing
in the new sensation about him at every door, as a district
visitor distributes tracts. The gypsy noted his
uneasiness and resented it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it feel like to be afraid?&#8221; she asked, eyeing
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid of nothing,&#8221; Gavin answered, offended
in turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you are. When you saw me come out of
Nanny&#8217;s you crept behind a tree; when these boys
showed themselves you shook. You are afraid of being
seen with me. Go away, then; I don&#8217;t want you.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Fear,&#8221; said Gavin, &#8220;is one thing, and prudence is
another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another name for it,&#8221; Babbie interposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all; but I owe it to my position to be careful.
Unhappily, you do not seem to feel&mdash;to recognise&mdash;to
know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To know what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us avoid the subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the Egyptian said, petulantly. &#8220;I hate not to
be told things. Why must you be &#8216;prudent?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should see,&#8221; Gavin replied, awkwardly, &#8220;that
there is a&mdash;a difference between a minister and a
gypsy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if I am willing to overlook it?&#8221; asked Babbie,
impertinently.</p>
<p>Gavin beat the brushwood mournfully with his staff.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot allow you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to talk disrespectfully
of my calling. It is the highest a man can follow. I
wish&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He checked himself; but he was wishing she could
see him in his pulpit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said the gypsy, reflectively, &#8220;one must
be very clever to be a minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As for that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; answered Gavin, waving his hand
grandly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it must be nice, too,&#8221; continued Babbie, &#8220;to be
able to speak for a whole hour to people who can neither
answer nor go away. Is it true that before you begin
to preach you lock the door to keep the congregation
in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must leave you if you talk in that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wanted to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Babbie, I am afraid you have little acquaintance
with the inside of churches. Do you sit under
anybody?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I sit under anybody?&#8221; repeated Babbie, blankly.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that the minister sighed? &#8220;Whom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
do you sit under?&#8221; was his form of salutation to
strangers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, where do you belong?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wanderers,&#8221; Babbie answered, still misunderstanding
him, &#8220;belong to nowhere in particular.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am only asking you if you ever go to church?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that is what you mean. Yes, I go often.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What church?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You promised not to ask questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only mean what denomination do you belong to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;Is there an English church
denomination?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin groaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that is my denomination,&#8221; said Babbie, cheerfully.
&#8220;Some day, though, I am coming to hear you
preach. I should like to see how you look in your gown.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t wear gowns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a shame! But I am coming, nevertheless. I
used to like going to church in Edinburgh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have lived in Edinburgh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We gypsies have lived everywhere,&#8221; Babbie said,
lightly, though she was annoyed at having mentioned
Edinburgh.</p>
<p>&#8220;But all gypsies don&#8217;t speak as you do,&#8221; said Gavin,
puzzled again. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you dinna,&#8221; replied Babbie, in broad
Scotch. &#8220;Maybe, if you did, you would think that it&#8217;s
mair imprudent in me to stand here cracking clavers
wi&#8217; the minister than for the minister to waste his time
cracking wi&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;&mdash;Oh, because prudence and I always
take different roads.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me who you are, Babbie,&#8221; the minister entreated;
&#8220;at least, tell me where your encampment is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have warned me against imprudence,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I want,&#8221; Gavin continued, earnestly, &#8220;to know your
people, your father and mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; he answered, stoutly, &#8220;I like their
daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that Babbie&#8217;s fingers played on one of the pans,
and, for the moment, there was no more badinage in her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a good man,&#8221; she said, abruptly; &#8220;but you
will never know my parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They may be; I cannot tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is all incomprehensible to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it is. I never asked any one to understand
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; said Gavin, excitedly; &#8220;but the time
has come when I must know everything of you that is
to be known.&#8221;</p>
<p>Babbie receded from him in quick fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must never speak to me in that way again,&#8221;
she said, in a warning voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin knew what way very well, but he thirsted to
hear in her words what his own had implied. She did
not choose to oblige him, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never will understand me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I daresay
I might be more like other people now, if&mdash;if I had
been brought up differently. Not,&#8221; she added, passionately,
&#8220;that I want to be like others. Do you never
feel, when you have been living a humdrum life for
months, that you must break out of it, or go crazy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her vehemence alarmed Gavin, who hastened to
reply&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;My life is not humdrum. It is full of excitement,
anxieties, pleasures, and I am too fond of the pleasures.
Perhaps it is because I have more of the luxuries of life
than you that I am so content with my lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what can you know of luxuries?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I have eighty pounds a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Babbie laughed. &#8220;Are ministers so poor?&#8221; she
asked, calling back her gravity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a considerable sum,&#8221; said Gavin, a little hurt,
for it was the first time he had ever heard any one speak
disrespectfully of eighty pounds.</p>
<p>The Egyptian looked down at her ring, and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall always remember your saying that,&#8221; she told
him, &#8220;after we have quarrelled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall not quarrel,&#8221; said Gavin, decidedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, we shall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We might have done so once, but we know each
other too well now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is why we are to quarrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221; said the minister. &#8220;I have not
blamed you for deriding my stipend, though how it can
seem small in the eyes of a gypsy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who can afford,&#8221; broke in Babbie, &#8220;to give Nanny
seven shillings a week?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; Gavin said, uncomfortably, while the Egyptian
again toyed with her ring. She was too impulsive
to be reticent except now and then, and suddenly she
said, &#8220;You have looked at this ring before now. Do
you know that if you had it on your finger you would
be more worth robbing than with eighty pounds in each
of your pockets?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get it?&#8221; demanded Gavin, fiercely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry I told you that,&#8221; the gypsy said, regretfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me how you got it,&#8221; Gavin insisted, his face
now hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you see, we are quarrelling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must know! You forget yourself,&#8221; she said
haughtily.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I have forgotten myself too long. Where
did you get that ring?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Good afternoon to you,&#8221; said the Egyptian, lifting
her pans.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not good afternoon,&#8221; he cried, detaining her.
&#8220;It is good-bye for ever, unless you answer me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I will not tell you
where I got my ring. It is no affair of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Babbie, it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was not, perhaps, greatly grieved to hear him
say so, for she made no answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are no gypsy,&#8221; he continued, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; she answered, again taking the pans.</p>
<p>&#8220;This dress is but a disguise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be. Why don&#8217;t you go away and leave me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going,&#8221; he replied, wildly. &#8220;I will have no
more to do with you. Formerly I pitied you, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He could not have used a word more calculated to
rouse the Egyptian&#8217;s ire, and she walked away with her
head erect. Only once did she look back, and it was
to say&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is prudence&mdash;now.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Chapter Nineteen.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO THE FIRST SERMON IN APPROVAL OF WOMEN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>A young man thinks that he alone of mortals is impervious
to love, and so the discovery that he is in it
suddenly alters his views of his own mechanism. It is
thus not unlike a rap on the funny-bone. Did Gavin
make this discovery when the Egyptian left him?
Apparently he only came to the brink of it and
stood blind. He had driven her from him for ever,
and his sense of loss was so acute that his soul
cried out for the cure rather than for the name of the
malady.</p>
<p>In time he would have realised what had happened,
but time was denied him, for just as he was starting for
the mud house Babbie saved his dignity by returning
to him. It was not her custom to fix her eyes on the
ground as she walked, but she was doing so now, and
at the same time swinging the empty pans. Doubtless
she had come back for more water, in the belief that
Gavin had gone. He pronounced her name with a
sense of guilt, and she looked up surprised, or seemingly
surprised, to find him still there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you had gone away long ago,&#8221; she said
stiffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Otherwise,&#8221; asked Gavin the dejected, &#8220;you would
not have come back to the well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sorry. Had you waited another moment
I should have been gone.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>This was said in apology, but the wilful Egyptian
chose to change its meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no right to blame me for disturbing you,&#8221;
she declared with warmth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not. I only&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could have been a mile away by this time.
Nanny wanted more water.&#8221;</p>
<p>Babbie scrutinised the minister sharply as she made
this statement. Surely her conscience troubled her,
for on his not answering immediately she said, &#8220;Do
you presume to disbelieve me? What could have made
me return except to fill the pans again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; Gavin admitted eagerly, &#8220;and I assure
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Babbie should have been grateful to his denseness,
but it merely set her mind at rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say anything against me you choose,&#8221; she told him.
&#8220;Say it as brutally as you like, for I won&#8217;t listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped to hear his response to that, and she
looked so cold that it almost froze on Gavin&#8217;s lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no right,&#8221; he said, dolefully, &#8220;to speak to you
as I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had not,&#8221; answered the proud Egyptian. She
was looking away from him to show that his repentance
was not even interesting to her. However, she had
forgotten already not to listen.</p>
<p>&#8220;What business is it of mine?&#8221; asked Gavin, amazed
at his late presumption, &#8220;whether you are a gypsy or
no?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And as for the ring&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here he gave her an opportunity of allowing that his
curiosity about the ring was warranted. She declined
to help him, however, and so he had to go on.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ring is yours,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and why should you
not wear it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, indeed?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid I have a very bad temper.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused for a contradiction, but she nodded her
head in agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it is no wonder,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that you think
me a&mdash;a brute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it is not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Babbie, I want you to know that I despise myself
for my base suspicions. No sooner did I see them
than I loathed them and myself for harbouring them.
Despite this mystery, I look upon you as a noble-hearted
girl. I shall always think of you so.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time Babbie did not reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was all I had to say,&#8221; concluded Gavin, &#8220;except
that I hope you will not punish Nanny for my sins.
Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; said the Egyptian, who was looking at
the well.</p>
<p>The minister&#8217;s legs could not have heard him give
the order to march, for they stood waiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; said the Egyptian, after a moment,
&#8220;that you said you were going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was only&mdash;brushing my hat,&#8221; Gavin answered
with dignity. &#8220;You want me to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>She bowed, and this time he did set off.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can go if you like,&#8221; she remarked now.</p>
<p>He turned at this.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began, diffidently.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I did not,&#8221; she answered, with indignation.</p>
<p>He could see her face at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you are crying!&#8221; he exclaimed, in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you are so unfeeling,&#8221; sobbed Babbie.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have I said, what have I done?&#8221; cried Gavin,
in an agony of self-contempt. &#8220;Oh, that I had gone
away at once!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is cruel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></div>
<p>&#8220;To say that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That you wished you had gone away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely,&#8221; the minister faltered, &#8220;you asked me
to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you say so?&#8221; asked the gypsy, reproachfully.</p>
<p>Gavin was distracted. &#8220;On my word,&#8221; he said,
earnestly, &#8220;I thought you did. And now I have made
you unhappy. Babbie, I wish I were anybody but myself;
I am a hopeless lout.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you are unjust,&#8221; said Babbie, hiding her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Again? To you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you stupid,&#8221; she said, beaming on him in her
most delightful manner, &#8220;to yourself!&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave him both her hands impetuously, and he
did not let them go until she added:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so glad that you are reasonable at last. Men
are so much more unreasonable than women, don&#8217;t you
think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we are,&#8221; Gavin said, diplomatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you are. Why, every one knows that.
Well, I forgive you; only remember, you have admitted
that it was all your fault?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was pointing her finger at him like a schoolmistress,
and Gavin hastened to answer&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were not to blame at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to hear you say that,&#8221; explained the representative
of the more reasonable sex, &#8220;because it was
really all my fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was; but of course I could not say so until
you had asked my pardon. You must understand that?&#8221;</p>
<p>The representative of the less reasonable sex could
not understand it, but he agreed recklessly, and it
seemed so plain to the woman that she continued confidentially&mdash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I pretended that I did not want to make it up, but I
did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you?&#8221; asked Gavin, elated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but nothing could have induced me to make
the first advance. You see why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I was so unreasonable?&#8221; asked Gavin,
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and nasty. You admit you were nasty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly, I have an evil temper. It has brought
me to shame many times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said the Egyptian, charitably.
&#8220;I like it. I believe I admire bullies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I bully you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never knew such a bully. You quite frightened
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin began to be less displeased with himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are sure,&#8221; inquired Babbie, &#8220;that you had no
right to question me about the ring?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain,&#8221; answered Gavin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will tell you all about it,&#8221; said Babbie, &#8220;for
it is natural that you should want to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked eagerly at her, and she had become serious
and sad.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must tell you at the same time,&#8221; she said, &#8220;who I
am, and then&mdash;then we shall never see each other any
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should you tell me?&#8221; cried Gavin, his hand
rising to stop her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you have a right to know,&#8221; she replied,
now too much in earnest to see that she was yielding a
point. &#8220;I should prefer not to tell you; yet there is
nothing wrong in my secret, and it may make you think
of me kindly when I have gone away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak in that way, Babbie, after you have
forgiven me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I hurt you? It was only because I know that
you cannot trust me while I remain a mystery. I know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
you would try to trust me, but doubts would cross your
mind. Yes, they would; they are the shadows that
mysteries cast. Who can believe a gypsy if the odds
are against her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can,&#8221; said Gavin; but she shook her head, and so
would he had he remembered three recent sermons of
his own preaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had better tell you all,&#8221; she said, with an effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my turn now to refuse to listen to you,&#8221; exclaimed
Gavin, who was only a chivalrous boy. &#8220;Babbie,
I should like to hear your story, but until you want
to tell it to me I will not listen to it. I have faith in
your honour, and that is sufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was boyish, but I am glad Gavin said it; and now
Babbie admired something in him that deserved admiration.
His faith, no doubt, made her a better
woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I admit that I would rather tell you nothing just
now,&#8221; she said, gratefully. &#8220;You are sure you will
never say again that you don&#8217;t understand me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite sure,&#8221; said Gavin, bravely. &#8220;And by-and-by
you will offer to tell me of your free will?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t let us think of the future,&#8221; answered
Babbie. &#8220;Let us be happy for the moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>This had been the Egyptian&#8217;s philosophy always,
but it was ill-suited for Auld Licht ministers, as one of
them was presently to discover.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to make one confession, though,&#8221; Babbie
continued, almost reluctantly. &#8220;When you were so
nasty a little while ago, I didn&#8217;t go back to Nanny&#8217;s.
I stood watching you from behind a tree, and then, for
an excuse to come back, I&mdash;I poured out the water.
Yes, and I told you another lie. I really came back to
admit that it was all my fault, if I could not get you to
say that it was yours. I am so glad you gave in first.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was very near him, and the tears had not yet
dried on her eyes. They were laughing eyes, eyes in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
distress, imploring eyes. Her pale face, smiling, sad,
dimpled, yet entreating forgiveness, was the one prominent
thing in the world to him just then. He wanted
to kiss her. He would have done it as soon as her eyes
rested on his, but she continued without regarding
him&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;How mean that sounds! Oh, if I were a man I
should wish to be everything that I am not, and nothing
that I am. I should scorn to be a liar, I should choose
to be open in all things, I should try to fight the world
honestly. But I am only a woman, and so&mdash;well, that
is the kind of man I should like to marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A minister may be all these things,&#8221; said Gavin,
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man I could love,&#8221; Babbie went on, not heeding
him, almost forgetting that he was there, &#8220;must
not spend his days in idleness as the men I know do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be brave, no mere worker among others,
but a leader of men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All ministers are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who makes his influence felt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Assuredly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And takes the side of the weak against the strong,
even though the strong be in the right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always my tendency.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man who has a mind of his own, and having once
made it up stands to it in defiance even of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of his session.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of the world. He must understand me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And be my master.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is his lawful position in the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must not yield to my coaxing or tempers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be weakness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But compel me to do his bidding; yes, even thrash
me if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If you won&#8217;t listen to reason. Babbie,&#8221; cried Gavin,
&#8220;I am that man!&#8221;</p>
<p>Here the inventory abruptly ended, and these two
people found themselves staring at each other, as if of
a sudden they had heard something dreadful. I do not
know how long they stood thus, motionless and horrified.
I cannot tell even which stirred first. All I know is
that almost simultaneously they turned from each other
and hurried out of the wood in opposite directions.</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />END OF THE STATE OF INDECISION.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Long before I had any thought of writing this story,
I had told it so often to my little maid that she now
knows some of it better than I. If you saw me looking
up from my paper to ask her, &#8220;What was it that Birse
said to Jean about the minister&#8217;s flowers?&#8221; or, &#8220;Where
was Hendry Munn hidden on the night of the riots?&#8221;
and heard her confident answers, you would conclude
that she had been in the thick of these events, instead
of born many years after them. I mention this now
because I have reached a point where her memory contradicts
mine. She maintains that Rob Dow was told
of the meeting in the wood by the two boys whom it
disturbed, while my own impression is that he was a
witness of it. If she is right, Rob must have succeeded
in frightening the boys into telling no other person, for
certainly the scandal did not spread in Thrums. After
all, however, it is only important to know that Rob did
learn of the meeting. Its first effect was to send him
sullenly to the drink.</p>
<p>Many a time since these events have I pictured what
might have been their upshot had Dow confided their
discovery to me. Had I suspected why Rob was grown
so dour again, Gavin&#8217;s future might have been very
different. I was meeting Rob now and again in the
glen, asking, with an affected carelessness he did not
bottom, for news of the little minister, but what he told
me was only the gossip of the town; and what I should
have known, that Thrums might never know it, he kept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
to himself. I suppose he feared to speak to Gavin, who
made several efforts to reclaim him, but without avail.</p>
<p>Yet Rob&#8217;s heart opened for a moment to one man, or
rather was forced open by that man. A few days after
the meeting at the well, Rob was bringing the smell of
whisky with him down Banker&#8217;s Close when he ran
against a famous staff, with which the doctor pinned
him to the wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said the outspoken doctor, looking contemptuously
into Rob&#8217;s bleary eyes, &#8220;so this is what your
conversion amounts to? Faugh! Rob Dow, if you
were half a man the very thought of what Mr. Dishart
has done for you would make you run past the public
houses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the thocht o&#8217; him that sends me running to
them,&#8221; growled Rob, knocking down the staff. &#8220;Let
me alane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; demanded McQueen,
hooking him this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speir at himsel&#8217;; speir at the woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your staff out o&#8217; my neck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not till you tell me why you, of all people, are
speaking against the minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>Torn by a desire for a confidant and loyalty to Gavin,
Rob was already in a fury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say again,&#8221; he burst forth, &#8220;that I was speaking
agin the minister and I&#8217;ll practise on you what I&#8217;m
awid to do to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&#8217;s wha?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The woman whom the minister&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said nothing about a woman,&#8221; said poor Rob,
alarmed for Gavin. &#8220;Doctor, I&#8217;m ready to swear afore
a bailie that I never saw them thegither at the Kaims.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Kaims!&#8221; exclaimed the doctor suddenly enlightened.
&#8220;Pooh! you only mean the Egyptian.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
Rob, make your mind easy about this. I know why he
met her there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you ken that she has bewitched him; do you
ken I saw him trying to put his arms round her; do you
ken they have a trysting-place in Caddam wood?&#8221;</p>
<p>This came from Rob in a rush, and he would fain
have called it all back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m drunk, doctor, roaring drunk,&#8221; he said, hastily,
&#8220;and it wasna the minister I saw ava; it was another
man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing more could the doctor draw from Rob, but
he had heard sufficient to smoke some pipes on. Like
many who pride themselves on being recluses, McQueen
loved the gossip that came to him uninvited; indeed,
he opened his mouth to it as greedily as any man in
Thrums. He respected Gavin, however, too much to
find this new dish palatable, and so his researches to
discover whether other Auld Lichts shared Rob&#8217;s fears
were conducted with caution. &#8220;Is there no word of
your minister&#8217;s getting a wife yet?&#8221; he asked several,
but only got for answers, &#8220;There&#8217;s word o&#8217; a Glasgow
leddy&#8217;s sending him baskets o&#8217; flowers,&#8221; or &#8220;He has
his een open, but he&#8217;s taking his time; ay, he&#8217;s looking
for the blade o&#8217; corn in the stack o&#8217; chaff.&#8221;</p>
<p>This convinced McQueen that the congregation knew
nothing of the Egyptian, but it did not satisfy him, and
he made an opportunity of inviting Gavin into the
surgery. It was, to the doctor, the cosiest nook in his
house, but to me and many others a room that smelled
of hearses. On the top of the pipes and tobacco tins
that littered the table there usually lay a death certificate,
placed there deliberately by the doctor to scare his
sister, who had a passion for putting the surgery to
rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; McQueen said, after he and Gavin
had talked a little while, &#8220;did I ever advise you to
smoke?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is your usual form of salutation,&#8221; Gavin answered,
laughing. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t think you ever supplied me
with a reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I daresay not. I am too experienced a doctor to
cheapen my prescriptions in that way. However, here
is one good reason. I have noticed, sir, that at your
age a man is either a slave to a pipe or to a woman.
Do you want me to lend you a pipe now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I am to understand,&#8221; asked Gavin, slyly,
&#8220;that your locket came into your possession in your
pre-smoking days, and that you merely wear it from
habit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tuts!&#8221; answered the doctor, buttoning his coat. &#8220;I
told you there was nothing in the locket. If there is, I
have forgotten what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a hopeless old bachelor, I see,&#8221; said Gavin,
unaware that the doctor was probing him. He was
surprised next moment to find McQueen in the ecstasies
of one who has won a rubber.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then,&#8221; cried the jubilant doctor, &#8220;as you have
confessed so much, tell me all about her. Name and
address, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confess! What have I confessed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t do, Mr. Dishart, for even your face betrays
you. No, no, I am an old bird, but I have not forgotten
the ways of the fledgelings. &#8216;Hopeless bachelor,&#8217;
sir, is a sweetmeat in every young man&#8217;s mouth until
of a sudden he finds it sour, and that means the banns.
When is it to be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must find the lady first,&#8221; said the minister,
uncomfortably.</p>
<p>&#8220;You tell me, in spite of that face, that you have not
fixed on her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The difficulty, I suppose, would be to persuade her
to fix on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. But you admit there is some one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who would have me?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You are wriggling out of it. Is it the banker&#8217;s
daughter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Gavin cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear you have walked up the back wynd with her
three times this week. The town is in a ferment about
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a great deal in the back wynd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fiddle-de-dee! I am oftener in the back wynd than
you, and I never meet her there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is curious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t, but never mind. Perhaps you have
fallen to Miss Pennycuick&#8217;s piano? Did you hear it
going as we passed the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She seems always to be playing on her piano.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not she; but you are supposed to be musical, and
so when she sees you from her window she begins to
thump. If I am in the school wynd and hear the piano
going, I know you will turn the corner immediately.
However, I am glad to hear it is not Miss Pennycuick.
Then it is the factor at the Spittal&#8217;s lassie? Well done,
sir. You should arrange to have the wedding at the
same time as the old earl&#8217;s, which comes off in summer,
I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One foolish marriage is enough in a day, doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? You call him a fool for marrying a young
wife? Well, no doubt he is, but he would have been a
bigger fool to marry an old one. However, it is not
Lord Rintoul we are discussing, but Gavin Dishart. I
suppose you know that the factor&#8217;s lassie is an heiress?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, therefore, would scorn me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try her,&#8221; said the doctor, drily. &#8220;Her father and
mother, as I know, married on a ten-pound note. But
if I am wrong again, I must adopt the popular view in
Thrums. It is a Glasgow lady after all? Man, you
needn&#8217;t look indignant at hearing that the people are
discussing your intended. You can no more stop it
than a doctor&#8217;s orders could keep Lang Tammas out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
church. They have discovered that she sends you
flowers twice every week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They never reach me,&#8221; answered Gavin, then remembered
the holly and winced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some,&#8221; persisted the relentless doctor, &#8220;even speak
of your having been seen together; but of course, if she
is a Glasgow lady, that is a mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did they see us?&#8221; asked Gavin, with a sudden
trouble in his throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are shaking,&#8221; said the doctor, keenly, &#8220;like a
medical student at his first operation. But as for the
story that you and the lady have been seen together, I
can guess how it arose. Do you remember that gypsy
girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor had begun by addressing the fire, but he
suddenly wheeled round and fired his question in the
minister&#8217;s face. Gavin, however, did not even blink.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I have forgotten her?&#8221; he replied,
coolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, in the stress of other occupations. But it was
your getting the money from her at the Kaims for
Nanny that I was to speak of. Absurd though it seems,
I think some dotard must have seen you and her at the
Kaims, and mistaken her for the lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>McQueen flung himself back in his chair to enjoy this
joke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fancy mistaking that woman for a lady!&#8221; he said
to Gavin, who had not laughed with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Nanny has some justification for considering
her a lady,&#8221; the minister said, firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I grant that. But what made me guffaw was
a vision of the harum-scarum, devil-may-care little
Egyptian mistress of an Auld Licht manse!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is neither harum-scarum nor devil-may-care,&#8221;
Gavin answered, without heat, for he was no longer a
distracted minister. &#8220;You don&#8217;t understand her as I
do.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, I seem to understand her differently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know of her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is just it,&#8221; said the doctor, irritated by Gavin&#8217;s
coolness. &#8220;I know she saved Nanny from the poorhouse,
but I don&#8217;t know where she got the money. I
know she can talk fine English when she chooses, but I
don&#8217;t know where she learned it. I know she heard
that the soldiers were coming to Thrums before they
knew of their destination themselves, but I don&#8217;t know
who told her. You who understand her can doubtless
explain these matters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She offered to explain them to me,&#8221; Gavin answered,
still unmoved, &#8220;but I forbade her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no business of yours, doctor. Forgive me for
saying so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Thrums,&#8221; replied McQueen, &#8220;a minister&#8217;s business
is everybody&#8217;s business. I have often wondered
who helped her to escape from the soldiers that night.
Did she offer to explain that to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said the doctor, sharply, &#8220;because it was
unnecessary?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You helped her to escape?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you are not ashamed of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why were you so anxious to screen her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She saved some of my people from gaol.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which was more than they deserved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always understood that you concealed two of
them in your own stable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I did,&#8221; the doctor had to allow. &#8220;But I
took my stick to them next morning. Besides, they
were Thrums folk, while you had never set eyes on
that imp of mischief before.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I cannot sit here, doctor, and hear her called names,&#8221;
Gavin said, rising, but McQueen gripped him by the
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;For pity&#8217;s sake, sir, don&#8217;t let us wrangle like a pair
of women. I brought you here to speak my mind to
you, and speak it I will. I warn you, Mr. Dishart,
that you are being watched. You have been seen
meeting this lassie in Caddam as well as at the Kaims.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the whole town watch, doctor. I have met her
openly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why? Oh, don&#8217;t make Nanny your excuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t. I met her because I love her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you mad?&#8221; cried McQueen. &#8220;You speak as if
you would marry her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Gavin, determinedly, &#8220;and I mean to
do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor flung up his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I give you up,&#8221; he said, raging. &#8220;I give you up.
Think of your congregation, man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been thinking of them, and as soon as I have
a right to do so I shall tell them what I have told you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And until you tell them I will keep your madness
to myself, for I warn you that, as soon as they do know,
there will be a vacancy in the Auld Licht kirk of
Thrums.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a woman,&#8221; said Gavin, hesitating, though
preparing to go, &#8220;of whom any minister might be
proud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a woman,&#8221; the doctor roared, &#8220;that no congregation
would stand. Oh, if you will go, there is
your hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps Gavin&#8217;s face was whiter as he left the house
than when he entered it, but there was no other change.
Those who were watching him decided that he was
looking much as usual, except that his mouth was shut
very firm, from which they concluded that he had been
taking the doctor to task for smoking. They also noted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
that he returned to McQueen&#8217;s house within half an
hour after leaving it, but remained no time.</p>
<p>Some explained this second visit by saying that the
minister had forgotten his cravat, and had gone back
for it. What really sent him back, however, was his
conscience. He had said to McQueen that he helped
Babbie to escape from the soldiers because of her kindness
to his people, and he returned to own that it was a
lie.</p>
<p>Gavin knocked at the door of the surgery, but entered
without waiting for a response. McQueen was no
longer stamping through the room, red and furious.
He had even laid aside his pipe. He was sitting back
in his chair, looking half-mournfully, half-contemptuously,
at something in his palm. His hand closed
instinctively when he heard the door open, but Gavin
had seen that the object was an open locket.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was only your reference to the thing,&#8221; the detected
doctor said, with a grim laugh, &#8220;that made me open it.
Forty years ago, sir, I&mdash;&mdash;Phew! it is forty-two years,
and I have not got over it yet.&#8221; He closed the locket
with a snap. &#8220;I hope you have come back, Dishart,
to speak more rationally?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin told him why he had come back, and the
doctor said he was a fool for his pains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it useless, Dishart, to make another appeal to
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite useless, doctor,&#8221; Gavin answered, promptly.
&#8220;My mind is made up at last.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-One.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />NIGHT&mdash;MARGARET&mdash;FLASHING OF A LANTERN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>That evening the little minister sat silently in his
parlour. Darkness came, and with it weavers rose
heavy-eyed from their looms, sleepy children sought
their mothers, and the gate of the field above the manse
fell forward to let cows pass to their byre; the great
Bible was produced in many homes, and the ten o&#8217;clock
bell clanged its last word to the night. Margaret had
allowed the lamp to burn low. Thinking that her boy
slept, she moved softly to his side and spread her shawl
over his knees. He had forgotten her. The doctor&#8217;s
warnings scarcely troubled him. He was Babbie&#8217;s
lover. The mystery of her was only a veil hiding her
from other men, and he was looking through it upon
the face of his beloved.</p>
<p>It was a night of long ago, but can you not see my
dear Margaret still as she bends over her son? Not
twice in many days dared the minister snatch a moment&#8217;s
sleep from grey morning to midnight, and, when
this did happen, he jumped up by-and-by in shame, to
revile himself for an idler and ask his mother wrathfully
why she had not tumbled him out of his chair? To-night
Margaret was divided between a desire to let him
sleep and a fear of his self-reproach when he awoke;
and so, perhaps, the tear fell that roused him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not like to waken you,&#8221; Margaret said, apprehensively.
&#8220;You must have been very tired, Gavin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was not sleeping, mother,&#8221; he said, slowly. &#8220;I
was only thinking.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Gavin, you never rise from your loom. It is
hardly fair that your hands should be so full of other
people&#8217;s troubles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They only fill one hand, mother; I carry the people&#8217;s
joys in the other hand, and that keeps me erect, like a
woman between her pan and pitcher. I think the joys
have outweighed the sorrows since we came here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been all joy to me, Gavin, for you never tell
me of the sorrows. An old woman has no right to be
so happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old woman, mother!&#8221; said Gavin. But his indignation
was vain. Margaret was an old woman. I
made her old before her time.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for these terrible troubles,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I forget
them the moment I enter the garden and see you at
your window. And, maybe, I keep some of the joys
from you as well as the troubles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Words about Babbie leaped to his mouth, but with
an effort he restrained them. He must not tell his
mother of her until Babbie of her free will had told him
all there was to tell.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been a selfish woman, Gavin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You selfish, mother!&#8221; Gavin said, smiling. &#8220;Tell
me when you did not think of others before yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always, Gavin. Has it not been selfishness to hope
that you would never want to bring another mistress
to the manse? Do you remember how angry you used
to be in Glasgow when I said that you would marry
some day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; Gavin said, sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; you used to say, &#8216;Don&#8217;t speak of such a thing,
mother, for the horrid thought of it is enough to drive
all the Hebrew out of my head.&#8217; Was not that lightning
just now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not see it. What a memory you have, mother,
for all the boyish things I said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t deny,&#8221; Margaret admitted with a sigh, &#8220;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
I liked to hear you speak in that way, though I knew
you would go back on your word. You see, you have
changed already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How, mother?&#8221; asked Gavin, surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said just now that those were boyish speeches.
Gavin, I can&#8217;t understand the mothers who are glad
to see their sons married; though I had a dozen I
believe it would be a wrench to lose one of them.
It would be different with daughters. You are laughing,
Gavin!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, at your reference to daughters. Would you
not have preferred me to be a girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Deed I would not,&#8221; answered Margaret, with tremendous
conviction. &#8220;Gavin, every woman on earth, be
she rich or poor, good or bad, offers up one prayer
about her firstborn, and that is, &#8216;May he be a boy!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you are wrong, mother. The banker&#8217;s wife
told me that there is nothing for which she thanks the
Lord so much as that all her children are girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May she be forgiven for that, Gavin!&#8221; exclaimed
Margaret; &#8220;though she maybe did right to put the best
face on her humiliation. No, no, there are many kinds
of women in the world, but there never was one yet
that didn&#8217;t want to begin with a laddie. You can speculate
about a boy so much more than about a girl.
Gavin, what is it a woman thinks about the day her son
is born? yes, and the day before too? She is picturing
him a grown man, and a slip of a lassie taking him
from her. Ay, that is where the lassies have their revenge
on the mothers. I remember as if it were this
morning a Harvie fishwife patting your head and asking
who was your sweetheart, and I could never thole the
woman again. We were at the door of the cottage, and
I mind I gripped you up in my arms. You had on a
tartan frock with a sash and diamond socks. When I
look back, Gavin, it seems to me that you have shot up
from that frock to manhood in a single hour.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There are not many mothers like you,&#8221; Gavin said,
laying his hand fondly on Margaret&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many better mothers, but few such sons.
It is easily seen why God could not afford me another.
Gavin, I am sure that was lightning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it was; but don&#8217;t be alarmed, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am never frightened when you are with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I always will be with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, if you were married&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; asked Gavin, indignantly, &#8220;that it
would make any difference to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret did not answer. She knew what a difference
it would make.</p>
<p>&#8220;Except,&#8221; continued Gavin, with a man&#8217;s obtuseness,
&#8220;that you would have a daughter as well as a son to
love you and take care of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret could have told him that men give themselves
away needlessly who marry for the sake of their
mother, but all she said was&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gavin, I see you can speak more composedly of
marrying now than you spoke a year ago. If I did not
know better, I should think a Thrums young lady had
got hold of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a moment before Gavin replied; then he said,
gaily&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, mother, the way the best of women speak of
each other is lamentable. You say I should be better
married, and then you take for granted that every
marriageable woman in the neighbourhood is trying
to kidnap me. I am sure you did not take my father
by force in that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not see that Margaret trembled at the mention
of his father. He never knew that she was many times
pining to lay her head upon his breast and tell him of
me. Yet I cannot but believe that she always shook
when Adam Dishart was spoken of between them. I
cannot think that the long-cherishing of the secret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
which was hers and mine kept her face steady when
that horror suddenly confronted her as now. Gavin
would have suspected much had he ever suspected anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Margaret said, courageously, &#8220;that you
would be better married; but when it comes to selecting
the woman I grow fearful. O Gavin!&#8221; she said, earnestly,
&#8220;it is an awful thing to marry the wrong man!&#8221;</p>
<p>Here in a moment had she revealed much, though
far from all, and there must have been many such moments
between them. But Gavin was thinking of his
own affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the wrong woman, don&#8217;t you, mother?&#8221;
he said, and she hastened to agree. But it was the
wrong man she meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;The difficulty, I suppose, is to hit upon the right
one?&#8221; Gavin said, blithely.</p>
<p>&#8220;To know which is the right one in time,&#8221; answered
Margaret, solemnly. &#8220;But I am saying nothing
against the young ladies of Thrums, Gavin. Though
I have scarcely seen them, I know there are good
women among them. Jean says&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe, mother,&#8221; Gavin interposed, reproachfully,
&#8220;that you have been questioning Jean about them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just because I was afraid&mdash;I mean because I fancied&mdash;you
might be taking a liking to one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is Jean&#8217;s verdict?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She says every one of them would jump at you, like
a bird at a berry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the berry cannot be divided. How would Miss
Pennycuick please you, mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gavin!&#8221; cried Margaret, in consternation, &#8220;you
don&#8217;t mean to&mdash;&mdash;But you are laughing at me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there is the banker&#8217;s daughter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t thole her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I question if you ever set eyes on her,
mother.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not, Gavin; but I have suspected her ever
since she offered to become one of your tract distributors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctor,&#8221; said Gavin, not ill-pleased, &#8220;was saying
that either of these ladies would suit me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What business has he,&#8221; asked Margaret, vindictively,
&#8220;to put such thoughts into your head?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he only did as you are doing. Mother, I see
you will never be satisfied without selecting the woman
for me yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, Gavin,&#8221; said Margaret, earnestly; &#8220;and I question
if I should be satisfied even then. But I am sure
I should be a better guide to you than Dr. McQueen is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am convinced of that. But I wonder what sort of
woman would content you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever pleased you, Gavin, would content me,&#8221;
Margaret ventured to maintain. &#8220;You would only take
to a clever woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She must be nearly as clever as you, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoots, Gavin,&#8221; said Margaret, smiling, &#8220;I&#8217;m not
to be caught with chaff. I am a stupid, ignorant
woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I must look out for a stupid, ignorant woman,
for that seems to be the kind I like,&#8221; answered Gavin,
of whom I may confess here something that has to be
told sooner or later. It is this: he never realised that
Babbie was a great deal cleverer than himself. Forgive
him, you who read, if you have any tolerance for the
creature, man.</p>
<p>&#8220;She will be terribly learned in languages,&#8221; pursued
Margaret, &#8220;so that she may follow you in your studies,
as I have never been able to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your face has helped me more than Hebrew,
mother,&#8221; replied Gavin. &#8220;I will give her no marks for
languages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At any rate,&#8221; Margaret insisted, &#8220;she must be a
grand housekeeper, and very thrifty.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></div>
<p>&#8220;As for that,&#8221; Gavin said, faltering a little, &#8220;one
can&#8217;t expect it of a mere girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should expect it,&#8221; maintained his mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no; but she would have you,&#8221; said Gavin, happily,
&#8220;to teach her housekeeping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a pleasant occupation to me, that,&#8221;
Margaret admitted. &#8220;And she would soon learn: she
would be so proud of her position as mistress of a
manse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; Gavin said, doubtfully. He had no doubt
on the subject in his college days.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we can take for granted,&#8221; continued his mother,
&#8220;that she is a lassie of fine character.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Gavin, holding his head high, as
if he thought the doctor might be watching him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have thought,&#8221; Margaret went on, &#8220;that there
was a great deal of wisdom in what you said at that
last marriage in the manse, the one where, you remember,
the best man and the bridesmaid joined hands instead
of the bride and bridegroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I say?&#8221; asked the little minister, with
misgivings.</p>
<p>&#8220;That there was great danger when people married
out of their own rank of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;well, of course, that would depend on circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were wise words, Gavin. There was the sermon,
too, that you preached a month or two ago against
marrying into other denominations. Jean told me that
it greatly impressed the congregation. It is a sad sight,
as you said, to see an Auld Licht lassie changing her
faith because her man belongs to the U. P.&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I say that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did, and it so struck Jean that she told me she
would rather be an old maid for life, &#8216;the which,&#8217; she
said, &#8216;is a dismal prospect,&#8217; than marry out of the Auld
Licht kirk.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps that was a rather narrow view I took,
mother. After all, the fitting thing is that the wife
should go with her husband; especially if it is he
that is the Auld Licht.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t hold with narrowness myself, Gavin,&#8221; Margaret
said, with an effort, &#8220;and admit that there are
many respectable persons in the other denominations.
But though a weaver might take a wife from another
kirk without much scandal, an Auld Licht minister&#8217;s
madam must be Auld Licht born and bred. The congregation
would expect no less. I doubt if they would
be sure of her if she came from some other Auld Licht
kirk. &#8217;Deed, though she came from our own kirk, I&#8217;m
thinking the session would want to catechise her. Ay,
and if all you tell me of Lang Tammas be true (for, as
you know, I never spoke to him), I warrant he would
catechise the session.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would brook no interference from my session,&#8221;
said Gavin, knitting his brows, &#8220;and I do not consider
it necessary that a minister&#8217;s wife should have been
brought up in his denomination. Of course she would
join it. We must make allowance, mother, for the
thousands of young women who live in places where
there is no Auld Licht kirk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can pity them, Gavin,&#8221; said Margaret, &#8220;without
marrying them. A minister has his congregation
to think of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So the doctor says,&#8221; interposed her son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it was just like his presumption!&#8221; cried Margaret.
&#8220;A minister should marry to please himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Decidedly he should,&#8221; Gavin agreed, eagerly, &#8220;and
the bounden duty of the congregation is to respect and
honour his choice. If they forget that duty, his is to
remind them of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, well, Gavin,&#8221; said Margaret, confidently, &#8220;your
congregation are so fond of you that your choice would
doubtless be theirs. Jean tells me that even Lang
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
Tammas, though he is so obstinate, has a love for you
passing the love of woman. These were her words.
Jean is more sentimental than you might think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish he would show his love,&#8221; said Gavin, &#8220;by
contradicting me less frequently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have Rob Dow to weigh against him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I cannot make out what has come over Rob
lately. He is drinking heavily again, and avoiding
me. The lightning is becoming very vivid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I hear no thunder. There is another thing,
Gavin. I am one of those that like to sit at home, but
if you had a wife she would visit the congregation. A
truly religious wife would be a great help to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Religious,&#8221; Gavin repeated slowly. &#8220;Yes, but
some people are religious without speaking of it. If a
woman is good she is religious. A good woman who
has been, let us say, foolishly brought up, only needs
to be shown the right way to tread it. Mother, I question
if any man, minister or layman, ever yet fell in
love because the woman was thrifty, or clever, or went
to church twice on Sabbath.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that is true,&#8221; Margaret said, &#8220;and I would
not have it otherwise. But it is an awful thing, Gavin,
as you said from the pulpit two weeks ago, to worship
only at a beautiful face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think too much about what I say in the pulpit,
mother,&#8221; Gavin said, with a sigh, &#8220;though of course a
man who fell in love merely with a face would be a
contemptible creature. Yet I see that women do not
understand how beauty affects a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, my boy&mdash;oh, indeed, they do,&#8221; said Margaret,
who on some matters knew far more than her
son.</p>
<p>Twelve o&#8217;clock struck, and she rose to go to bed,
alarmed lest she should not waken early in the morning.
&#8220;But I am afraid I shan&#8217;t sleep,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if
that lightning continues.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is harmless,&#8221; Gavin answered, going to the window.
He started back next moment, and crying,
&#8220;Don&#8217;t look out, mother,&#8221; hastily pulled down the
blind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Gavin,&#8221; Margaret said in fear, &#8220;you look as
if it had struck you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; Gavin answered, with a forced laugh, and
he lit her lamp for her.</p>
<p>But it had struck him, though it was not lightning.
It was the flashing of a lantern against the window to
attract his attention, and the holder of the lantern was
Babbie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, Gavin. Don&#8217;t sit up any later.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Two.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />LOVERS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Only something terrible, Gavin thought, could have
brought Babbie to him at such an hour; yet when he
left his mother&#8217;s room it was to stand motionless on
the stair, waiting for a silence in the manse that would
not come. A house is never still in darkness to those
who listen intently; there is a whispering in distant
chambers, an unearthly hand presses the snib of the
window, the latch rises. Ghosts were created when
the first man woke in the night.</p>
<p>Now Margaret slept. Two hours earlier, Jean, sitting
on the salt-bucket, had read the chapter with which
she always sent herself to bed. In honour of the little
minister she had begun her Bible afresh when he came
to Thrums, and was progressing through it, a chapter
at night, sighing, perhaps, on washing days at a long
chapter, such as Exodus twelfth, but never making two
of it. The kitchen wag-at-the-wall clock was telling
every room in the house that she had neglected to shut
her door. As Gavin felt his way down the dark stair,
awakening it into protest at every step, he had a glimpse
of the pendulum&#8217;s shadow running back and forward
on the hearth; he started back from another shadow on
the lobby wall, and then seeing it start too, knew it for
his own. He opened the door and passed out unobserved;
it was as if the sounds and shadows that filled
the manse were too occupied with their game to mind
an interloper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you?&#8221; he said to a bush, for the garden was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
in semi-darkness. Then the lantern&#8217;s flash met him,
and he saw the Egyptian in the summer-seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;At last!&#8221; she said, reproachfully. &#8220;Evidently a
lantern is a poor door-bell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Gavin asked, in suppressed excitement,
for the least he expected to hear was that she was again
being pursued for her share in the riot. The tremor
in his voice surprised her into silence, and he thought
she faltered because what she had to tell him was so
woeful. So, in the darkness of the summer-seat, he
kissed her, and she might have known that with that
kiss the little minister was hers forever.</p>
<p>Now Babbie had been kissed before, but never thus,
and she turned from Gavin, and would have liked to be
alone, for she had begun to know what love was, and
the flash that revealed it to her laid bare her own
shame, so that her impulse was to hide herself from
her lover. But of all this Gavin was unconscious, and
he repeated his question. The lantern was swaying in
her hand, and when she turned fearfully to him its
light fell on his face, and she saw how alarmed he was.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going away back to Nanny&#8217;s,&#8221; she said suddenly,
and rose cowed, but he took her hand and held
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Babbie,&#8221; he said, huskily, &#8220;tell me what has happened
to bring you here at this hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sought to pull her hand from him, but could not.</p>
<p>&#8220;How you are trembling!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Babbie,&#8221;
he cried, &#8220;something terrible has happened to you, but
do not fear. Tell me what it is, and then&mdash;then I will
take you to my mother: yes, I will take you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Egyptian would have given all she had in the
world to be able to fly from him then, that he might
never know her as she was, but it could not be, and so
she spoke out remorselessly. If her voice had become
hard, it was a new-born scorn of herself that made it so.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are needlessly alarmed,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I am not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
at all the kind of person who deserves sympathy or expects
it. There is nothing wrong. I am staying with
Nanny over-night, and only came to Thrums to amuse
myself. I chased your policeman down the Roods with
my lantern, and then came here to amuse myself with
you. That is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was nothing but a love of mischief that brought you
here?&#8221; Gavin asked, sternly, after an unpleasant pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; the Egyptian answered, recklessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not have believed this of you,&#8221; the minister
said; &#8220;I am ashamed of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; Babbie retorted, trying to speak lightly
until she could get away from him, &#8220;that you would be
glad to see me. Your last words in Caddam seemed to
justify that idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sorry to see you,&#8221; he answered, reproachfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will go away at <ins title='Was one'>once</ins>,&#8221; she said, stepping out
of the summer-seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;you must go at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I won&#8217;t,&#8221; she said, turning back defiantly.
&#8220;I know what you are to say: that the Thrums people
would be shocked if they knew I was here; as if I cared
what the Thrums people think of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I care what they think of you,&#8221; Gavin said, as if
that were decisive, &#8220;and I tell you I will not allow you
to repeat this freak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You &#8216;will not allow me,&#8217;&#8221; echoed Babbie, almost
enjoying herself, despite her sudden loss of self-respect.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not,&#8221; Gavin said, resolutely. &#8220;Henceforth
you must do as I think fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since when have you taken command of me?&#8221; demanded
Babbie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since a minute ago,&#8221; Gavin replied, &#8220;when you let
me kiss you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let you!&#8221; exclaimed Babbie, now justly incensed.
&#8220;You did it yourself. I was very angry.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, you were not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not allowed to say that even?&#8221; asked the
Egyptian. &#8220;Tell me something I may say, then, and
I will repeat it after you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have something to say to you,&#8221; Gavin told her,
after a moment&#8217;s reflection; &#8220;yes, and there is something
I should like to hear you repeat after me, but
not to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hear what it is,&#8221; Babbie said, quickly,
but she knew what it was, and even then, despite the
new pain at her heart, her bosom swelled with pride
because this man still loved her. Now she wanted to
run away with his love for her before he could take it
from her, and then realising that this parting must be
forever, a great desire filled her to hear him put that
kiss into words, and she said, faltering:</p>
<p>&#8220;You can tell me what it is if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to-night,&#8221; said Gavin.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night, if at all,&#8221; the gypsy almost entreated.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow, at Nanny&#8217;s,&#8221; answered Gavin, decisively:
and this time he remembered without dismay
that the morrow was the Sabbath.</p>
<p>In the fairy tale the beast suddenly drops his skin and
is a prince, and I believed it seemed to Babbie that some
such change had come over this man, her plaything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your lantern is shining on my mother&#8217;s window,&#8221;
were the words that woke her from this discovery, and
then she found herself yielding the lantern to him.
She became conscious vaguely that a corresponding
change was taking place in herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;You spoke of taking me to your mother,&#8221; she said,
bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered at once, &#8220;to-morrow&#8221;; but she
shook her head, knowing that to-morrow he would be
wiser.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me the lantern,&#8221; she said, in a low voice, &#8220;I
am going back to Nanny&#8217;s now.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we must set out now, but I can
carry the lantern.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not coming with me!&#8221; she exclaimed, shaking
herself free of his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am coming,&#8221; he replied, calmly, though he was
not calm. &#8220;Take my arm, Babbie.&#8221;</p>
<p>She made a last effort to free herself from bondage,
crying passionately, &#8220;I will not let you come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I say I am coming,&#8221; Gavin answered between
his teeth, &#8220;I mean that I am coming, and so let that
be an end of this folly. Take my arm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I hate you,&#8221; she said, retreating from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take my arm,&#8221; he repeated, and, though her breast
was rising rebelliously, she did as he ordered, and so
he escorted her from the garden. At the foot of the
field she stopped, and thought to frighten him by saying,
&#8220;What would the people say if they saw you with
me now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does not much matter what they would say,&#8221; he
answered, still keeping his teeth together as if doubtful
of their courage. &#8220;As for what they would do, that is
certain; they would put me out of my church.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it is dear to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dearer than life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You told me long ago that your mother&#8217;s heart
would break if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am sure it would.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had begun to climb the fields, but she stopped
him with a jerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; she implored, clutching his
arm with both hands. &#8220;You make me very unhappy
for no purpose. Oh, why should you risk so much for
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot have you wandering here alone at midnight,&#8221;
Gavin answered, gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is nothing to me,&#8221; she said, eagerly, but no
longer resenting his air of proprietorship.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You will never do it again if I can prevent it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you cannot,&#8221; she said, sadly. &#8220;Oh, yes, you
can, Mr. Dishart. If you will turn back now I shall
promise never to do anything again without first asking
myself whether it would seem right to you. I know I
acted very wrongly to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only thoughtlessly,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then have pity on me,&#8221; she besought him, &#8220;and go
back. If I have only been thoughtless, how can you
punish me thus? Mr. Dishart,&#8221; she entreated, her
voice breaking, &#8220;if you were to suffer for this folly of
mine, do you think I could live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in God&#8217;s hands, dear,&#8221; he answered, firmly,
and he again drew her arm to him. So they climbed
the first field, and were almost at the hill before either
spoke again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop,&#8221; Babbie whispered, crouching as she spoke;
&#8220;I see some one crossing the hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen him for some time,&#8221; Gavin answered,
quietly; &#8220;but I am doing no wrong, and I will not
hide.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Egyptian had to walk on with him, and I suppose
she did not think the less of him for that. Yet
she said, warningly&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he sees you, all Thrums will be in an uproar before
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot help that,&#8221; Gavin replied. &#8220;It is the will
of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To ruin you for my sins?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If He thinks fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>The figure drew nearer, and with every step Babbie&#8217;s
distress doubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are walking straight to him,&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;I implore you to wait here until he passes, if not for
your own sake, for your mother&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that he wavered, and she heard his teeth sliding
against each other, as if he could no longer clench them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But, no,&#8221; he said moving on again, &#8220;I will not be
a skulker from any man. If it be God&#8217;s wish that I
should suffer for this, I must suffer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, why,&#8221; cried Babbie, beating her hands together
in grief, &#8220;should you suffer for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mine,&#8221; Gavin answered. Babbie gasped.
&#8220;And if you act foolishly,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;it is right
that I should bear the brunt of it. No, I will not let
you go on alone; you are not fit to be alone. You need
some one to watch over you and care for you and love
you, and, if need be, to suffer with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn back, dear, before he sees us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has seen us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, I had seen them, for the figure on the hill was
no other than the dominie of Glen Quharity. The
park gate clicked as it swung to, and I looked up and
saw Gavin and the Egyptian. My eyes should have
found them sooner, but it was to gaze upon Margaret&#8217;s
home, while no one saw me, that I had trudged into
Thrums so late, and by that time, I suppose, my eyes
were of little service for seeing through. Yet, when I
knew that of these two people suddenly beside me on
the hill one was the little minister and the other a
strange woman, I fell back from their side with dread
before I could step forward and cry &#8220;Gavin!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Mr. Dishart,&#8221; he answered, with a composure
that would not have served him for another sentence.
He was more excited than I, for the &#8220;Gavin&#8221; fell harmlessly
on him, while I had no sooner uttered it than
there rushed through me the shame of being false to
Margaret. It was the only time in my life that I forgot
her in him, though he has ever stood next to her in
my regard.</p>
<p>I looked from Gavin to the gypsy woman, and again
from her to him, and she began to tell a lie in his
interest. But she got no farther than &#8220;I met Mr. Dishart
accid&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; when she stopped, ashamed. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
reverence for Gavin that checked the lie. Not every
man has had such a compliment paid him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is natural,&#8221; Gavin said, slowly, &#8220;that you, sir,
should wonder why I am here with this woman at such
an hour, and you may know me so little as to think ill
of me for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did not answer, and he misunderstood my silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he continued, in a harder voice, as if I had
asked him a question, &#8220;I will explain nothing to you.
You are not my judge. If you would do me harm, sir,
you have it in your power.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was with these cruel words that Gavin addressed
me. He did not know how cruel they were. The
Egyptian, I think, must have seen that his suspicions
hurt me, for she said, softly, with a look of appeal in
her eyes&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the schoolmaster in Glen Quharity? Then
you will perhaps save Mr. Dishart the trouble of coming
farther by showing me the way to old Nanny
Webster&#8217;s house at Windyghoul?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to pass the house at any rate,&#8221; I answered
eagerly, and she came quickly to my side.</p>
<p>I knew, though in the darkness I could see but
vaguely, that Gavin was holding his head high and
waiting for me to say my worst. I had not told him
that I dared think no evil of him, and he still suspected
me. Now I would not trust myself to speak lest I
should betray Margaret, and yet I wanted him to know
that base doubts about him could never find a shelter in
me. I am a timid man who long ago lost the glory of
my life by it, and I was again timid when I sought to
let Gavin see that my faith in him was unshaken. I
lifted my bonnet to the gypsy, and asked her to take
my arm. It was done clumsily, I cannot doubt, but he
read my meaning and held out his hand to me. I had
not touched it since he was three years old, and I trembled
too much to give it the grasp I owed it. He and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
I parted without a word, but to the Egyptian he said,
&#8220;To-morrow, dear, I will see you at Nanny&#8217;s,&#8221; and he
was to kiss her, but I pulled her a step farther from
him, and she put her hands over her face, crying, &#8220;No,
no!&#8221;</p>
<p>If I asked her some questions between the hill and
Windyghoul you must not blame me, for this was my
affair as well as theirs. She did not answer me; I know
now that she did not hear me. But at the mud house
she looked abruptly into my face, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You love him, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>I trudged to the school house with these words for
company, and it was less her discovery than her confession
that tortured me. How much I slept that night
you may guess.</p>

</div>
<p>&#8220;The kirk bell will soon be ringing,&#8221; Nanny said on
the following morning, as she placed herself carefully
on a stool, one hand holding her Bible and the other
wandering complacently over her aged merino gown.
&#8220;Ay, lassie, though you&#8217;re only an Egyptian I would
hae ta&#8217;en you wi&#8217; me to hear Mr. Duthie, but it&#8217;s speiring
ower muckle o&#8217; a woman to expect her to gang to
the kirk in her ilka day claethes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Babbie of yesterday would have laughed at this,
but the new Babbie sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder you don&#8217;t go to Mr. Dishart&#8217;s church now,
Nanny,&#8221; she said, gently. &#8220;I am sure you prefer him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Babbie, Babbie,&#8221; exclaimed Nanny, with spirit,
&#8220;may I never be so far left to mysel&#8217; as to change my
kirk just because I like another minister better! It&#8217;s
easy seen, lassie, that you ken little o&#8217; religious questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very little,&#8221; Babbie admitted, sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But dinna be so waeful about it,&#8221; the old woman
continued, kindly, &#8220;for that&#8217;s no nane like you. Ay,
and if you see muckle mair o&#8217; Mr. Dishart he&#8217;ll soon
cure your ignorance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not see much more of him,&#8221; Babbie answered,
with averted head.</p>
<p>&#8220;The like o&#8217; you couldna expect it,&#8221; Nanny said,
simply, whereupon Babbie went to the window. &#8220;I
had better be stepping,&#8221; Nanny said, rising, &#8220;for I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
aye late unless I&#8217;m on the hill by the time the bell begins.
Ay, Babbie, I&#8217;m doubting my merino&#8217;s no sair
in the fashion?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked down at her dress half despondently, and
yet with some pride.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was fowerpence the yard, and no less,&#8221; she went
on, fondling the worn merino, &#8220;when we bocht it at
Sam&#8217;l Curr&#8217;s. Ay, but it has been turned sax times
since syne.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sighed, and Babbie came to her and put her
arms round her, saying, &#8220;Nanny, you are a dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a gey auld-farrant-looking dear, I doubt,&#8221; said
Nanny, ruefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Nanny,&#8221; rejoined Babbie, &#8220;you are just wanting
me to flatter you. You know the merino looks very
nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a guid merino yet,&#8221; admitted the old woman,
&#8220;but, oh, Babbie, what does the material matter if the
cut isna fashionable? It&#8217;s fine, isn&#8217;t it, to be in the
fashion?&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke so wistfully that, instead of smiling, Babbie
kissed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid to lay hand on the merino, Nanny, but
give me off your bonnet and I&#8217;ll make it ten years
younger in as many minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you?&#8221; asked Nanny, eagerly, unloosening her
bonnet-strings. &#8220;Mercy on me!&#8221; she had to add; &#8220;to
think about altering bonnets on the Sabbath-day!
Lassie, how could you propose sic a thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me, Nanny,&#8221; Babbie replied, so meekly
that the old woman looked at her curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dinna understand what has come ower you,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;There&#8217;s an unca difference in you since last nicht.
I used to think you were mair like a bird than a lassie,
but you&#8217;ve lost a&#8217; your daft capers o&#8217; singing and lauching,
and I take ill wi&#8217;t. Twa or three times I&#8217;ve catched
you greeting. Babbie, what has come ower you?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, Nanny. I think I hear the bell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Down in Thrums two kirk-officers had let their bells
loose, waking echoes in Windyghoul as one dog in
country parts sets all the others barking, but Nanny
did not hurry off to church. Such a surprising notion
had filled her head suddenly that she even forgot to
hold her dress off the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Babbie,&#8221; she cried, in consternation, &#8220;dinna tell
me you&#8217;ve gotten ower fond o&#8217; Mr. Dishart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The like of me, Nanny!&#8221; the gypsy answered, with
affected raillery, but there was a tear in her eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a wild, presumptious thing,&#8221; Nanny
said, &#8220;and him a grand minister, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Babbie tried to look her in the face, but failed, and
then all at once there came back to Nanny the days
when she and her lover wandered the hill together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, my dawtie,&#8221; she cried, so tenderly, &#8220;what does
it matter wha he is when you canna help it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Two frail arms went round the Egyptian, and Babbie
rested her head on the old woman&#8217;s breast. But do
you think it could have happened had not Nanny loved
a weaver two-score years before?</p>
<p>And now Nanny has set off for church and Babbie is
alone in the mud house. Some will pity her not at all,
this girl who was a dozen women in the hour, and all
made of impulses that would scarce stand still to be
photographed. To attempt to picture her at any time
until now would have been like chasing a spirit that
changes to something else as your arms clasp it; yet
she has always seemed a pathetic little figure to me.
If I understand Babbie at all, it is, I think, because I
loved Margaret, the only woman I have ever known
well, and one whose nature was not, like the Egyptian&#8217;s,
complex, but most simple, as if God had told her only
to be good. Throughout my life since she came into it
she has been to me a glass in which many things are
revealed that I could not have learned save through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
her, and something of all womankind, even of bewildering
Babbie, I seem to know because I knew Margaret.</p>
<p>No woman is so bad but we may rejoice when her
heart thrills to love, for then God has her by the hand.
There is no love but this. She may dream of what
love is, but it is only of a sudden that she knows.
Babbie, who was without a guide from her baby days,
had dreamed but little of it, hearing its name given to
another thing. She had been born wild and known no
home; no one had touched her heart except to strike it,
she had been educated, but never tamed; her life had
been thrown strangely among those who were great in
the world&#8217;s possessions, but she was not of them. Her
soul was in such darkness that she had never seen it;
she would have danced away cynically from the belief
that there is such a thing, and now all at once she had
passed from disbelief to knowledge. Is not love God&#8217;s
doing? To Gavin He had given something of Himself,
and the moment she saw it the flash lit her own soul.</p>
<p>It was but little of his Master that was in Gavin, but
far smaller things have changed the current of human
lives; the spider&#8217;s thread that strikes our brow on a
country road may do that. Yet this I will say, though
I have no wish to cast the little minister on my pages
larger than he was, that he had some heroic hours in
Thrums, of which one was when Babbie learned to love
him. Until the moment when he kissed her she had
only conceived him a quaint fellow whose life was a
string of Sundays, but behold what she saw in him
now. Evidently to his noble mind her mystery was
only some misfortune, not of her making, and his was
to be the part of leading her away from it into the happiness
of the open life. He did not doubt her, for he
loved, and to doubt is to dip love in the mire. She had
been given to him by God, and he was so rich in her
possession that the responsibility attached to the gift
was not grievous. She was his, and no mortal man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
could part them. Those who looked askance at her
were looking askance at him; in so far as she was wayward
and wild, he was those things; so long as she remained
strange to religion, the blame lay on him.</p>
<p>All this Babbie read in the Gavin of the past night,
and to her it was the book of love. What things she
had known, said and done in that holy name! How
shamefully have we all besmirched it! She had only
known it as the most selfish of the passions, a brittle
image that men consulted because it could only answer
in the words they gave it to say. But here was a man
to whom love was something better than his own desires
leering on a pedestal. Such love as Babbie had seen
hitherto made strong men weak, but this was a love
that made a weak man strong. All her life, strength
had been her idol, and the weakness that bent to her
cajolery her scorn. But only now was it revealed to
her that strength, instead of being the lusty child of
passions, grows by grappling with and throwing them.</p>
<p>So Babbie loved the little minister for the best that
she had ever seen in man. I shall be told that she
thought far more of him than he deserved, forgetting
the mean in the worthy: but who that has had a glimpse
of heaven will care to let his mind dwell henceforth on
earth? Love, it is said, is blind, but love is not blind.
It is an extra eye, which shows us what is most worthy
of regard. To see the best is to see most clearly, and
it is the lover&#8217;s privilege.</p>
<p>Down in the Auld Licht kirk that forenoon Gavin
preached a sermon in praise of Woman, and up in the
mudhouse in Windyghoul Babbie sat alone. But it was
the Sabbath day to her: the first Sabbath in her life.
Her discovery had frozen her mind for a time, so that
she could only stare at it with eyes that would not shut;
but that had been in the night. Already her love
seemed a thing of years, for it was as old as herself, as
old as the new Babbie. It was such a dear delight that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
she clasped it to her, and exulted over it because it was
hers, and then she cried over it because she must give
it up.</p>
<p>For Babbie must only look at this love and then turn
from it. My heart aches for the little Egyptian, but
the Promised Land would have remained invisible to
her had she not realized that it was only for others.
That was the condition of her seeing.</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Four.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />THE NEW WORLD, AND THE WOMAN WHO MAY NOT DWELL THEREIN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Up here in the glen school-house after my pupils have
straggled home, there comes to me at times, and so sudden
that it may be while I am infusing my tea, a hot desire
to write great books. Perhaps an hour afterwards
I rise, beaten, from my desk, flinging all I have written
into the fire (yet rescuing some of it on second thought),
and curse myself as an ingle-nook man, for I see that
one can only paint what he himself has felt, and in my
passion I wish to have all the vices, even to being an
impious man, that I may describe them better. For
this may I be pardoned. It comes to nothing in the
end, save that my tea is brackish.</p>
<p>Yet though my solitary life in the glen is cheating
me of many experiences, more helpful to a writer than
to a Christian, it has not been so tame but that I can
understand why Babbie cried when she went into
Nanny&#8217;s garden and saw the new world. Let no one
who loves be called altogether unhappy. Even love
unreturned has its rainbow, and Babbie knew that
Gavin loved her. Yet she stood in woe among the stiff
berry bushes, as one who stretches forth her hands to
Love and sees him looking for her, and knows she must
shrink from the arms she would lie in, and only call to
him in a voice he cannot hear. This is not a love that
is always bitter. It grows sweet with age. But could
that dry the tears of the little Egyptian, who had only
been a woman for a day?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>Much was still dark to her. Of one obstacle that
must keep her and Gavin ever apart she knew, and he
did not; but had it been removed she would have given
herself to him humbly, not in her own longing, but because
he wanted her. &#8220;Behold what I am,&#8221; she could
have said to him then, and left the rest to him, believing
that her unworthiness would not drag him down, it
would lose itself so readily in his strength. That
Thrums could rise against such a man if he defied it,
she did not believe; but she was to learn the truth
presently from a child.</p>
<p>To most of us, I suppose, has come some shock that
was to make us different men from that hour, and yet,
how many days elapsed before something of the man
we had been leapt up in us? Babbie thought she had
buried her old impulsiveness, and then remembering
that from the top of the field she might see Gavin returning
from church, she hastened to the hill to look
upon him from a distance. Before she reached the gate
where I had met her and him, however, she stopped,
distressed at her selfishness, and asked bitterly, &#8220;Why
am I so different from other women; why should what
is so easy to them be so hard to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gavin, my beloved!&#8221; the Egyptian cried in her
agony, and the wind caught her words and flung them
in the air, making sport of her.</p>
<p>She wandered westward over the bleak hill, and by-and-by
came to a great slab called the Standing Stone,
on which children often sit and muse until they see gay
ladies riding by on palfreys&mdash;a kind of horse&mdash;and
knights in glittering armour, and goblins, and fiery
dragons, and other wonders now extinct, of which bare-legged
laddies dream, as well as boys in socks. The
Standing Stone is in the dyke that separates the hill
from a fir wood, and it is the fairy-book of Thrums. If
you would be a knight yourself, you must sit on it and
whisper to it your desire.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>Babbie came to the Standing Stone, and there was a
little boy astride it. His hair stood up through holes
in his bonnet, and he was very ragged and miserable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you crying, little boy?&#8221; Babbie asked him,
gently; but he did not look up, and the tongue was
strange to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you greeting so sair?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no greeting very sair,&#8221; he answered, turning
his head from her that a woman might not see his tears.
&#8220;I&#8217;m no greeting so sair but what I grat sairer when
my mither died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When did she die?&#8221; Babbie inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lang syne,&#8221; he answered, still with averted face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Micah is my name. Rob Dow&#8217;s my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And have you no brothers nor sisters?&#8221; asked Babbie,
with a fellow-feeling for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, juist my father,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should be the better laddie to him then. Did
your mither no tell you to be that afore she died?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;she telled me ay to hide the
bottle frae him when I could get haed o&#8217;t. She took me
into the bed to make me promise that, and syne she died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does your father drina?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He hauds mair than ony other man in Thrums,&#8221;
Micah replied, almost proudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And he strikes you?&#8221; Babbie asked, compassionately.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lie,&#8221; retorted the boy, fiercely. &#8220;Leastwise,
he doesna strike me except when he&#8217;s mortal, and
syne I can jouk him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wishing. It&#8217;s a wishing stane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are wishing your father wouldna drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m no,&#8221; answered Micah. &#8220;There was a lang
time he didna drink, but the woman has sent him to it
again. It&#8217;s about her I&#8217;m wishing. I&#8217;m wishing she
was in hell.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What woman is it?&#8221; asked Babbie, shuddering.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna ken,&#8221; Micah said, &#8220;but she&#8217;s an ill ane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you never see her at your father&#8217;s house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na; if he could get grip o&#8217; her he would break her
ower his knee. I hearken to him saying that, when he&#8217;s
wild. He says she should be burned for a witch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if he hates her,&#8221; asked Babbie, &#8220;how can she
have sic power ower him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no him that she has haud o&#8217;,&#8221; replied Micah,
still looking away from her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha is it then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Mr. Dishart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Babbie was struck as if by an arrow from the wood.
It was so unexpected that she gave a cry, and then for
the first time Micah looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;How should that send your father to the drink?&#8221;
she asked, with an effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because my father&#8217;s michty fond o&#8217; him,&#8221; answered
Micah, staring strangely at her; &#8220;and when the folk
ken about the woman, they&#8217;ll stane the minister out o&#8217;
Thrums.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wood faded for a moment from the Egyptian&#8217;s
sight. When it came back, the boy had slid off the
Standing Stone and was stealing away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you run frae me?&#8221; Babbie asked, pathetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fleid at you,&#8221; he gasped, coming to a standstill
at a safe distance: &#8220;you&#8217;re the woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>Babbie cowered before her little judge, and he drew
nearer her slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think that?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>It was a curious time for Babbie&#8217;s beauty to be paid
its most princely compliment.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;re so bonny,&#8221; Micah whispered across
the dyke. Her tears gave him courage. &#8220;You micht
gang awa,&#8221; he entreated. &#8220;If you kent what a differ
Mr. Dishart made in my father till you came, you would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
maybe gang awa. When he&#8217;s roaring fou I have to
sleep in the wood, and it&#8217;s awfu&#8217; cauld. I&#8217;m doubting
he&#8217;ll kill me, woman, if you dinna gang awa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor Babbie put her hand to her heart, but the innocent
lad continued mercilessly&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;If ony shame comes to the minister, his auld
mither&#8217;ll die. How have you sic an ill will at the
minister?&#8221;</p>
<p>Babbie held up her hands like a supplicant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll gie you my rabbit,&#8221; Micah said, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll gang
awa. I&#8217;ve juist the ane.&#8221; She shook her head, and,
misunderstanding her, he cried, with his knuckles in
his eye, &#8220;I&#8217;ll gie you them baith, though I&#8217;m michty
sweer to part wi&#8217; Spotty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then at last Babbie found her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your rabbits, laddie,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and greet no
more. I&#8217;m gaen awa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll never come back no more a&#8217; your life?&#8221;
pleaded Micah.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never no more a&#8217; my life,&#8221; repeated Babbie.</p>
<p>&#8220;And ye&#8217;ll leave the minister alane for ever and
ever?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For ever and ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Micah rubbed his face dry, and said, &#8220;Will you let me
stand on the Standing Stane and watch you gaen awa
for ever and ever?&#8221;</p>
<p>At that a sob broke from Babbie&#8217;s heart, and looking
at her doubtfully Micah said&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re gey ill for what you&#8217;ve done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; Babbie answered, &#8220;I&#8217;m gey ill for what I&#8217;ve
done.&#8221;</p>
<p>A minute passed, and in her anguish she did not know
that still she was standing at the dyke. Micah&#8217;s voice
roused her:</p>
<p>&#8220;You said you would gang awa, and you&#8217;re no gaen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Babbie went away. The boy watched her across
the hill. He climbed the Standing Stone and gazed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
after her until she was but a coloured ribbon among the
broom. When she disappeared into Windyghoul he
ran home joyfully, and told his father what a good day&#8217;s
work he had done. Rob struck him for a fool for taking
a gypsy&#8217;s word, and warned him against speaking of
the woman in Thrums.</p>

<p>But though Dow believed that Gavin continued to
meet the Egyptian secretly, he was wrong. A sum of
money for Nanny was sent to the minister, but he could
guess only from whom it came. In vain did he search
for Babbie. Some months passed and he gave up the
search, persuaded that he should see her no more. He
went about his duties with a drawn face that made many
folk uneasy when it was stern, and pained them when it
tried to smile. But to Margaret, though the effort was
terrible, he was as he had ever been, and so no thought
of a woman crossed her loving breast.</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Five.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />BEGINNING OF THE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>I can tell still how the whole of the glen was engaged
about the hour of noon on the fourth of August month;
a day to be among the last forgotten by any of us,
though it began as quietly as a roaring March. At the
Spittal, between which and Thrums this is a halfway
house, were gathered two hundred men in kilts, and
many gentry from the neighboring glens, to celebrate
the earl&#8217;s marriage, which was to take place on the
morrow, and thither, too, had gone many of my pupils
to gather gossip, at which girls of six are trustier hands
than boys of twelve. Those of us, however, who were
neither children nor of gentle blood, remained at home,
the farmers more taken up with the want of rain, now
become a calamity, than with an old man&#8217;s wedding,
and their womenfolk wringing their hands for rain also,
yet finding time to marvel at the marriage&#8217;s taking
place at the Spittal instead of in England, of which the
ignorant spoke vaguely as an estate of the bride&#8217;s.</p>
<p>For my own part I could talk of the disastrous drought
with Waster Lunny as I walked over his parched fields,
but I had not such cause as he to brood upon it by day
and night; and the ins and outs of the earl&#8217;s marriage
were for discussing at a tea-table, where there were
women to help one to conclusions, rather than for the
reflections of a solitary dominie, who had seen neither
bride nor bridegroom. So it must be confessed that
when I might have been regarding the sky moodily, or
at the Spittal, where a free table that day invited all, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
was sitting in the school-house, heeling my left boot,
on which I have always been a little hard.</p>
<p>I made small speed, not through lack of craft, but
because one can no more drive in tackets properly than
take cities unless he gives his whole mind to it; and
half of mine was at the Auld Licht manse. Since our
meeting six months earlier on the hill I had not seen
Gavin, but I had heard much of him, and of a kind to
trouble me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw nothing queer about Mr. Dishart,&#8221; was Waster
Lunny&#8217;s frequent story, &#8220;till I hearkened to Elspeth
speaking about it to the lasses (for I&#8217;m the last
Elspeth would tell onything to, though I&#8217;m her man),
and syne I minded I had been noticing it for months.
Elspeth says,&#8221; he would go on, for he could no more
forbear quoting his wife than complaining of her, &#8220;that
the minister&#8217;ll listen to you nowadays wi&#8217; his een glaring
at you as if he had a perfectly passionate interest
in what you were telling him (though it may be only
about a hen wi&#8217; the croup), and then, after all, he hasna
heard a sylib. Ay, I listened to Elspeth saying that,
when she thocht I was at the byre, and yet, would you
believe it, when I says to her after lousing time, &#8216;I&#8217;ve
been noticing of late that the minister loses what a body
tells him,&#8217; all she answers is &#8216;Havers.&#8217; Tod, but
women&#8217;s provoking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I allow,&#8221; Birse said, &#8220;that on the first Sabbath o&#8217;
June month, and again on the third Sabbath, he poured
out the Word grandly, but I&#8217;ve ta&#8217;en note this curran
Sabbaths that if he&#8217;s no michty magnificent he&#8217;s michty
poor. There&#8217;s something damming up his mind, and
when he gets by it he&#8217;s a roaring water, but when he
doesna he&#8217;s a despizable trickle. The folk thinks it&#8217;s a
woman that&#8217;s getting in his way, but dinna tell me
that about sic a scholar; I tell you he would gang ower
a toon o&#8217; women like a loaded cart ower new-laid
stanes.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>Wearyworld hobbled after me up the Roods one day,
pelting me with remarks, though I was doing my best
to get away from him. &#8220;Even Rob Dow sees there&#8217;s
something come ower the minister,&#8221; he bawled, &#8220;for
Rob&#8217;s fou ilka Sabbath now. Ay, but this I will say
for Mr. Dishart, that he aye gies me a civil word,&#8221;
I thought I had left the policeman behind with this,
but next minute he roared, &#8220;And whatever is the matter
wi&#8217; him it has made him kindlier to me than ever.&#8221;
He must have taken the short cut through Lunan&#8217;s close,
for at the top of the Roods his voice again made up on
me. &#8220;Dagone you, for a cruel pack to put your fingers
to your lugs ilka time I open my mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Waster Lunny&#8217;s daughter Easie, who got her
schooling free for redding up the school-house and
breaking my furniture, she would never have been off
the gossip about the minister, for she was her mother
in miniature, with a tongue that ran like a pump after
the pans are full, not for use but for the mere pleasure
of spilling.</p>
<p>On that awful fourth of August I not only had all
this confused talk in my head but reason for jumping
my mind between it and the Egyptian (as if to catch
them together unawares), and I was like one who, with
the mechanism of a watch jumbled in his hand, could
set it going if he had the art.</p>
<p>Of the gypsy I knew nothing save what I had seen
that night, yet what more was there to learn? I was
aware that she loved Gavin and that he loved her. A
moment had shown it to me. Now with the Auld
Lichts, I have the smith&#8217;s acquaintance with his irons,
and so I could not believe that they would suffer their
minister to marry a vagrant. Had it not been for this
knowledge, which made me fearful for Margaret, I
would have done nothing to keep these two young people
apart. Some to whom I have said this maintain
that the Egyptian turned my head at our first meeting.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
Such an argument is not perhaps worth controverting.
I admit that even now I straighten under the fire of a
bright eye, as a pensioner may salute when he sees a
young officer. In the shooting season, should I chance
to be leaning over my dyke while English sportsmen
pass (as is usually the case if I have seen them approaching),
I remember nought of them save that they call
me &#8220;she,&#8221; and end their greetings with &#8220;whatever&#8221;
(which Waster Lunny takes to be a southron mode of
speech), but their ladies dwell pleasantly in my memory,
from their engaging faces to the pretty crumpled thing
dangling on their arms, that is a hat or a basket, I am
seldom sure which. The Egyptian&#8217;s beauty, therefore,
was a gladsome sight to me, and none the less so that
I had come upon it as unexpectedly as some men step
into a bog. Had she been alone when I met her I cannot
deny that I would have been content to look on her
face, without caring what was inside it; but she was
with her lover, and that lover was Gavin, and so her
face was to me as little for admiring as this glen in a
thunderstorm, when I know that some fellow-creature
is lost on the hills.</p>
<p>If, however, it was no quick liking for the gypsy that
almost tempted me to leave these two lovers to each
other, what was it? It was the warning of my own
life. Adam Dishart had torn my arm from Margaret&#8217;s,
and I had not recovered the wrench in eighteen years.
Rather than act his part between these two I felt tempted
to tell them, &#8220;Deplorable as the result may be, if you
who are a minister marry this vagabond, it will be still
more deplorable if you do not.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was Margaret to consider, and at thought
of her I cursed the Egyptian aloud. What could I do
to keep Gavin and the woman apart? I could tell him
the secret of his mother&#8217;s life. Would that be sufficient?
It would if he loved Margaret, as I did not doubt. Pity
for her would make him undergo any torture rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
than she should suffer again. But to divulge our old
connection would entail her discovery of me, and I
questioned if even the saving of Gavin could destroy
the bitterness of that.</p>
<p>I might appeal to the Egyptian. I might tell her
even what I shuddered to tell him. She cared for him,
I was sure, well enough to have the courage to give
him up. But where was I to find her?</p>
<p>Were she and Gavin meeting still? Perhaps the
change which had come over the little minister meant
that they had parted. Yet what I had heard him say
to her on the hill warned me not to trust in any such
solution of the trouble.</p>
<p>Boys play at casting a humming-top into the midst
of others on the ground, and if well aimed it scatters
them prettily. I seemed to be playing such a game
with my thoughts, for each new one sent the others
here and there, and so what could I do in the end but
fling my tops aside, and return to the heeling of my
boot?</p>
<p>I was thus engaged when the sudden waking of the
glen into life took me to my window. There is seldom
silence up here, for if the wind be not sweeping the
heather, the Quharity, that I may not have heard for
days, seems to have crept nearer to the school-house in
the night, and if both wind and water be out of earshot,
there is the crack of a gun, or Waster Lunny&#8217;s shepherd
is on a stone near at hand whistling, or a lamb is
scrambling through a fence, and kicking foolishly with
its hind legs. These sounds I am unaware of until
they stop, when I look up. Such a stillness was broken
now by music.</p>
<p>From my window I saw a string of people walking
rapidly down the glen, and Waster Lunny crossing his
potato-field to meet them. Remembering that, though
I was in my stocking soles, the ground was dry, I hastened
to join the farmer, for I like to miss nothing. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
saw a curious sight. In front of the little procession
coming down the glen road, and so much more impressive
than his satellites that they may be put of mind as
merely ploughman and the like following a show, was
a Highlander that I knew to be Lauchlan Campbell,
one of the pipers engaged to lend music to the earl&#8217;s
marriage. He had the name of a thrawn man when
sober, but pretty at the pipes at both times, and he
came marching down the glen blowing gloriously, as if
he had the clan of Campbell at his heels. I know no
man who is so capable on occasion of looking like twenty
as a Highland piper, and never have I seen a face in
such a blaze of passion as was Lauchlan Campbell&#8217;s
that day. His following were keeping out of his reach,
jumping back every time he turned round to shake his
fist in the direction of the Spittal. While this magnificent
man was yet some yards from us, I saw Waster
Lunny, who had been in the middle of the road to ask
questions, fall back in fear, and not being a fighting
man myself, I jumped the dyke. Lauchlan gave me a
look that sent me farther into the field, and strutted
past, shrieking defiance through his pipes, until I lost
him and his followers in a bend of the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a terrifying spectacle,&#8221; I heard Waster
Lunny say when the music had become but a distant
squeal. &#8220;You&#8217;re bonny at louping dykes, dominie,
when there is a wild bull in front o&#8217; you. Na, I canna
tell what has happened, but at the least Lauchlan maun
hae dirked the earl. Thae loons cried out to me as
they gaed by that he has been blawing awa&#8217; at that
tune till he canna halt. What a wind&#8217;s in the crittur!
I&#8217;m thinking there&#8217;s a hell in ilka Highlandman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care then, Waster Lunny, that you dinna licht
it,&#8221; said an angry voice that made us jump, though it
was only Duncan, the farmer&#8217;s shepherd, who spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had forgotten you was a Highlandman yoursel&#8217;,
Duncan,&#8221; Waster Lunny said nervously; but Elspeth,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
who had come to us unnoticed, ordered the shepherd to
return to the hillside, which he did haughtily.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you no lay haud on that blast o&#8217; wind,
Lauchlan Campbell,&#8221; asked Elspeth of her husband,
&#8220;and speir at him what had happened at the Spittal?
A quarrel afore a marriage brings ill luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking,&#8221; said the farmer, &#8220;that Rintoul&#8217;s
making his ain ill luck by marrying on a young leddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s never ower auld to marry,&#8221; said Elspeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, nor a woman,&#8221; rejoined Waster Lunny, &#8220;when
she gets the chance. But, Elspeth, I believe I can
guess what has fired that fearsome piper. Depend upon
it, somebody has been speaking disrespectful about the
crittur&#8217;s ancestors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His ancestors!&#8221; exclaimed Elspeth, scornfully.
&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking mine could hae bocht them at a crown
the dozen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoots,&#8221; said the farmer, &#8220;you&#8217;re o&#8217; a weaving
stock, and dinna understand about ancestors. Take a
stick to a Highland laddie, and it&#8217;s no him you hurt,
but his ancestors. Likewise it&#8217;s his ancestors that
stanes you for it. When Duncan stalked awa the now,
what think you he saw? He saw a farmer&#8217;s wife dauring
to order about his ancestors; and if that&#8217;s the way
wi&#8217; a shepherd, what will it be wi&#8217; a piper that has the
kilts on him a&#8217; day to mind him o&#8217; his ancestors ilka
time he looks down?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elspeth retired to discuss the probable disturbance at
the Spittal with her family, giving Waster Lunny the
opportunity of saying to me impressively&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, man, has it never crossed you that it&#8217;s a queer
thing the like o&#8217; you and me having no ancestors? Ay,
we had them in a manner o&#8217; speaking, no doubt, but
they&#8217;re as completely lost sicht o&#8217; as a flagon lid that&#8217;s
fallen ahint the dresser. Hech, sirs, but they would
need a gey rubbing to get the rust off them now. I&#8217;ve
been thinking that if I was to get my laddies to say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
their grandfather&#8217;s name a curran times ilka day, like
the Catechism, and they were to do the same wi&#8217; their
bairns, and it was continued in future generations, we
micht raise a fell field o&#8217; ancestors in time. Ay, but
Elspeth wouldna hear o&#8217;t. Nothing angers her mair
than to hear me speak o&#8217; planting trees for the benefit
o&#8217; them that&#8217;s to be farmers here after me; and as for
ancestors, she would howk them up as quick as I could
plant them. Losh, dominie, is that a boot in your
hand?&#8221;</p>
<p>To my mortification I saw that I had run out of the
school-house with the boot on my hand as if it were a
glove, and back I went straightway, blaming myself for
a man wanting in dignity. It was but a minor trouble
this, however, even at the time; and to recall it later in
the day was to look back on happiness, for though I did
not know it yet, Lauchlan&#8217;s playing raised the curtain
on the great act of Gavin&#8217;s life, and the twenty-four
hours had begun, to which all I have told as yet is no
more than the prologue.</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Six.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />SCENE AT THE SPITTAL.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Within an hour after I had left him, Waster Lunny
walked into the school-house and handed me his snuff-mull,
which I declined politely. It was with this ceremony
that we usually opened our conversations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen the post,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and he tells me there
has been a queer ploy at the Spittal. It&#8217;s a wonder the
marriage hasna been turned into a burial, and all because
o&#8217; that Highland stirk, Lauchlan Campbell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waster Lunny was a man who had to retrace his steps
in telling a story if he tried short cuts, and so my custom
was to wait patiently while he delved through the
ploughed fields that always lay between him and his
destination.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you ken, Rintoul&#8217;s so little o&#8217; a Scotchman that
he&#8217;s no muckle better than an Englisher. That maun
be the reason he hadna mair sense than to tramp on a
Highlandman&#8217;s ancestors, as he tried to tramp on
Lauchlan&#8217;s this day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Lord Rintoul insulted the piper,&#8221; I suggested,
giving the farmer a helping hand cautiously, &#8220;it would
be through inadvertence. Rintoul only bought the
Spittal a year ago, and until then, I daresay, he had
seldom been on our side of the Border.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a foolish interruption, for it set Waster
Lunny off in a new direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what Elspeth says. Says she, &#8216;When the
earl has grand estates in England, what for does he
come to a barren place like the Spittal to be married?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
It&#8217;s gey like,&#8217; she says, &#8216;as if he wanted the marriage
to be got by quietly; a thing,&#8217; says she, &#8216;that no woman
can stand. Furthermore,&#8217; Elspeth says, &#8216;how has the
marriage been postponed twice?&#8217; We ken what the
servants at the Spittal says to that, namely, that the
young lady is no keen to take him, but Elspeth winna
listen to sic arguments. She says either the earl had
grown timid (as mony a man does) when the wedding-day
drew near, or else his sister that keeps his house is
mad at the thocht o&#8217; losing her place; but as for the
young leddy&#8217;s being sweer, says Elspeth, &#8216;an earl&#8217;s an
earl however auld he is, and a lassie&#8217;s a lassie however
young she is, and weel she kens you&#8217;re never sure o&#8217; a
man&#8217;s no changing his mind about you till you&#8217;re tied
to him by law, after which it doesna so muckle matter
whether he changes his mind about you or no.&#8217; Ay,
there&#8217;s a quirk in it some gait, dominie; but it&#8217;s a deep
water Elspeth canna bottom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; I agreed; &#8220;but you were to tell me what
Birse told you of the disturbance at the Spittal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, weel,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;the post puts the wite
o&#8217;t on her little leddyship, as they call her, though she
winna be a leddyship till the morn. All I can say is
that if the earl was saft enough to do sic a thing out
of fondness for her, it&#8217;s time he was married on her,
so that he may come to his senses again. That&#8217;s what
I say; but Elspeth conters me, of course, and says she,
&#8216;If the young leddy was so careless o&#8217; insulting other
folks&#8217; ancestors, it proves she has nane o&#8217; her ain; for
them that has china plates themsel&#8217;s is the maist careful
no to break the china plates of others.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what was the insult? Was Lauchlan dismissed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Na, faags! It was waur than that. Dominie, you&#8217;re
dull in the uptake compared to Elspeth. I hadna telled
her half the story afore she jaloused the rest. However,
to begin again; there&#8217;s great feasting and rejoicings
gaen on at the Spittal the now, and also a banquet,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
which the post says is twa dinners in one. Weel,
there&#8217;s a curran Ogilvys among the guests, and it was
them that egged on her little leddyship to make the daring
proposal to the earl. What was the proposal? It
was no less than that the twa pipers should be ordered
to play &#8216;The Bonny House o&#8217; Airlie.&#8217; Dominie, I
wonder you can tak it so calm when you ken that&#8217;s the
Ogilvy&#8217;s sang, and that it&#8217;s aimed at the clan o&#8217; Campbell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; I said. &#8220;The Ogilvys and the Campbells
used to be mortal enemies, but the feud has been long
forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I&#8217;ve heard tell,&#8221; Waster Lunny said sceptically,
&#8220;that Airlie and Argyle shakes hands now like Christians;
but I&#8217;m thinking that&#8217;s just afore the Queen.
Dinna speak now, for I&#8217;m in the thick o&#8217;t. Her little
leddyship was all hinging in gold and jewels, the which
winna be her ain till the morn; and she leans ower to
the earl and whispers to him to get the pipers to play
&#8216;The Bonny House.&#8217; He wasna willing, for says he,
&#8216;There&#8217;s Ogilvys at the table, and ane o&#8217; the pipers is
a Campbell, and we&#8217;ll better let sleeping dogs lie.&#8217;
However, the Ogilvys lauched at his caution; and he
was so infatuated wi&#8217; her little leddyship that he gae
in, and he cried out to the pipers to strike up &#8216;The
Bonny House.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Waster Lunny pulled his chair nearer me and rested
his hand on my knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dominie,&#8221; he said in a voice that fell now and again
into a whisper, &#8220;them looking on swears that when
Lauchlan Campbell heard these monstrous orders his
face became ugly and black, so that they kent in a jiffy
what he would do. It&#8217;s said a&#8217; body jumped back frae
him in a sudden dread, except poor Angus, the other
piper, wha was busy tuning up for &#8216;The Bonny House.&#8217;
Weel, Angus had got no farther in the tune than the
first skirl when Lauchlan louped at him, and ripped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
up the startled crittur&#8217;s pipes wi&#8217; his dirk. The pipes
gae a roar o&#8217; agony like a stuck swine, and fell gasping
on the floor. What happened next was that Lauchlan
wi&#8217; his dirk handy for onybody that micht try to stop
him, marched once round the table, playing &#8216;The Campbells
are Coming,&#8217; and then straucht out o&#8217; the Spittal,
his chest far afore him, and his head so weel back that
he could see what was going on ahint. Frae the Spittal
to here he never stopped that fearsome tune, and I&#8217;se
warrant he&#8217;s blawing away at it at this moment through
the streets o&#8217; Thrums.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waster Lunny was not in his usual spirits, or he would
have repeated his story before he left me, for he had
usually as much difficulty in coming to an end as in
finding a beginning. The drought was to him as serious
a matter as death in the house, and as little to be
forgotten for a lengthened period.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s to be a prayer-meeting for rain in the Auld
Licht kirk the night,&#8221; he told me as I escorted him as
far as my side of the Quharity, now almost a dead
stream, pitiable to see, &#8220;and I&#8217;m gaen; though I&#8217;m
sweer to leave thae puir cattle o&#8217; mine. You should
see how they look at me when I gie them mair o&#8217; that
rotten grass to eat. It&#8217;s eneuch to mak a man greet,
for what richt hae I to keep kye when I canna meat
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Waster Lunny has said to me more than once that the
great surprise of his life was when Elspeth was willing
to take him. Many a time, however, I have seen that
in him which might have made any weaver&#8217;s daughter
proud of such a man, and I saw it again when we came
to the river side.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no ane o&#8217; thae farmers,&#8221; he said, truthfully,
&#8220;that&#8217;s aye girding at the weather, and Elspeth and
me kens that we hae been dealt wi&#8217; bountifully since we
took this farm wi&#8217; gey anxious hearts. That woman,
dominie, is eneuch to put a brave face on a coward, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
it&#8217;s no langer syne than yestreen when I was sitting in
the dumps, looking at the aurora borealis, which I
canna but regard as a messenger o&#8217; woe, that she put her
hand on my shoulder and she says, &#8216;Waster Lunny,
twenty year syne we began life thegither wi&#8217; nothing
but the claethes on our back, and an it please God we
can begin it again, for I hae you and you hae me, and
I&#8217;m no cast down if you&#8217;re no.&#8217; Dominie, is there
mony sic women in the warld as that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many a one,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, man, it shamed me, for I hae a kind o&#8217; delight
in angering Elspeth, just to see what she&#8217;ll say. I
could hae ta&#8217;en her on my knee at that minute, but the
bairns was there, and so it wouldna hae dune. But I
cheered her up, for, after all, the drought canna put us
so far back as we was twenty years syne, unless it&#8217;s true
what my father said, that the aurora borealis is the
devil&#8217;s rainbow. I saw it sax times in July month,
and it made me shut my een. You was out admiring
it, dominie, but I can never forget that it was seen in
the year twelve just afore the great storm. I was only
a laddie then, but I mind how that awful wind stripped
a&#8217; the standing corn in the glen in less time than we&#8217;ve
been here at the water&#8217;s edge. It was called the deil&#8217;s
besom. My father&#8217;s hinmost words to me was, &#8216;It&#8217;s
time eneuch to greet, laddie, when you see the aurora
borealis.&#8217; I mind he was so complete ruined in an hour
that he had to apply for relief frae the poor&#8217;s rates.
Think o&#8217; that, and him a proud man. He would tak&#8217;
nothing till one winter day when we was a&#8217; starving,
and syne I gaed wi&#8217; him to speir for&#8217;t, and he telled
me to grip his hand ticht, so that the cauldness o&#8217; mine
micht gie him courage. They were doling out the
charity in the Town&#8217;s House, and I had never been in&#8217;t
afore. I canna look at it now without thinking o&#8217; that
day when me and my father gaed up the stair thegither.
Mr. Duthie was presiding at the time, and he wasna
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
muckle older than Mr. Dishart is now. I mind he
speired for proof that we was needing, and my father
couldna speak. He just pointed at me. &#8216;But you
have a good coat on your back yoursel&#8217;,&#8217; Mr. Duthie
said, for there were mony waiting, sair needing. &#8216;It
was lended him to come here,&#8217; I cried, and without a
word my father opened the coat, and they saw he had
nothing on aneath, and his skin blue wi &#8217;cauld. Dominie,
Mr. Duthie handed him one shilling and saxpence,
and my father&#8217;s fingers closed greedily on&#8217;t for a minute,
and syne it fell to the ground. They put it back in his
hand, and it slipped out again, and Mr. Duthie gave
it back to him, saying, &#8216;Are you so cauld as that?&#8217; But,
oh, man, it wasna cauld that did it, but shame o&#8217; being
on the rates. The blood a&#8217; ran to my father&#8217;s head,
and syne left it as quick, and he flung down the siller
and walked out o&#8217; the Town House wi&#8217; me running
after him. We warstled through that winter, God kens
how, and it&#8217;s near a pleasure to me to think o&#8217;t now, for,
rain or no rain, I can never be reduced to sic straits
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The farmer crossed the water without using the stilts
which were no longer necessary, and I little thought,
as I returned to the school-house, what terrible things
were to happen before he could offer me his snuff-mull
again. Serious as his talk had been it was neither of
drought nor of the incident at the Spittal that I sat
down to think. My anxiety about Gavin came back to
me until I was like a man imprisoned between walls of
his own building. It may be that my presentiments
of that afternoon look gloomier now than they were,
because I cannot return to them save over a night of
agony, black enough to darken any time connected with
it. Perhaps my spirits only fell as the wind rose, for
wind ever takes me back to Harvie, and when I think
of Harvie my thoughts are of the saddest. I know that
I sat for some hours, now seeing Gavin pay the penalty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
of marrying the Egyptian, and again drifting back to
my days with Margaret, until the wind took to playing
tricks with me, so that I heard Adam Dishart enter
our home by the sea every time the school-house door
shook.</p>
<p>I became used to the illusion after starting several
times, and thus when the door did open, about seven
o&#8217;clock, it was only the wind rushing to my fire like a
shivering dog that made me turn my head. Then I
saw the Egyptian staring at me, and though her sudden
appearance on my threshold was a strange thing, I forgot
it in the whiteness of her face. She was looking
at me like one who has asked a question of life or
death, and stopped her heart for the reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; I cried, and for a moment I believe I
was glad she did not answer. She seemed to have told
me already as much as I could bear.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has not heard,&#8221; she said aloud in an expressionless
voice, and, turning, would have slipped away without
another word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is any one dead?&#8221; I asked, seizing her hands and
letting them fall, they were so clammy. She nodded,
and trying to speak could not.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is dead,&#8221; she said at last in a whisper. &#8220;Mr.
Dishart is dead,&#8221; and she sat down quietly.</p>
<p>At that I covered my face, crying, &#8220;God help Margaret!&#8221;
and then she rose, saying fiercely, so that I drew
back from her, &#8220;There is no Margaret; he only cared
for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is his mother,&#8221; I said hoarsely, and then she
smiled to me, so that I thought her a harmless mad
thing. &#8220;He was killed by a piper called Lauchlan
Campbell,&#8221; she said, looking up at me suddenly. &#8220;It
was my fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Margaret!&#8221; I wailed.</p>
<p>&#8220;And poor Babbie,&#8221; she entreated pathetically; &#8220;will
no one say, &#8216;Poor Babbie&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Seven.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />FIRST JOURNEY OF THE DOMINIE TO THRUMS DURING THE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;How did it happen?&#8221; I asked more than once, but
the Egyptian was only with me in the body, and she
did not hear. I might have been talking to some one a
mile away whom a telescope had drawn near my eyes.</p>
<p>When I put on my bonnet, however, she knew that I
was going to Thrums, and she rose and walked to the
door, looking behind to see that I followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not come,&#8221; I said harshly, but her hand
started to her heart as if I had shot her, and I added
quickly, &#8220;Come.&#8221; We were already some distance on
our way before I repeated my question.</p>
<p>&#8220;What matter how it happened?&#8221; she answered piteously,
and they were words of which I felt the force.
But when she said a little later, &#8220;I thought you would
say it is not true,&#8221; I took courage, and forced her to
tell me all she knew. She sobbed while she spoke, if
one may sob without tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard of it at the Spittal,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The news
broke out suddenly there that the piper had quarrelled
with some one in Thrums, and that in trying to separate
them Mr. Dishart was stabbed. There is no doubt of
its truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We should have heard of it here,&#8221; I said hopefully,
&#8220;before the news reached the Spittal. It cannot be
true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was brought to the Spittal,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;by
the hill road.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>Then my spirits sank again, for I knew that this was
possible. There is a path, steep but short, across the
hills between Thrums and the top of the glen, which
Mr. Glendinning took frequently when he had to preach
at both places on the same Sabbath. It is still called
the Minister&#8217;s Road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet if the earl had believed it he would have sent
some one into Thrums for particulars,&#8221; I said, grasping
at such comfort as I could make.</p>
<p>&#8220;He does believe it,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;He told me
of it himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>You see the Egyptian was careless of her secret now;
but what was that secret to me? An hour ago it would
have been much, and already it was not worth listening
to. If she had begun to tell me why Lord Rintoul took
a gypsy girl into his confidence I should not have heard
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ran quickly,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Even if a messenger was
sent he might be behind me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Was it her words or the tramp of a horse that made
us turn our heads at that moment? I know not. But
far back in a twist of the road we saw a horseman approaching
at such a reckless pace that I thought he was
on a runaway. We stopped instinctively, and waited
for him, and twice he disappeared in hollows of the
road, and then was suddenly tearing down upon us.
I recognised in him young Mr. McKenzie, a relative of
Rintoul, and I stretched out my arms to compel him to
draw up. He misunderstood my motive, and was raising
his whip threateningly, when he saw the Egyptian.
It is not too much to say that he swayed in the saddle.
The horse galloped on, though he had lost hold of the
reins. He looked behind until he rounded a corner,
and I never saw such amazement mixed with incredulity
on a human face. For some minutes I expected to see
him coming back, but when he did not I said wonderingly
to the Egyptian&mdash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He knew you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he?&#8221; she answered indifferently, and I think we
spoke no more until we were in Windyghoul. Soon
we were barely conscious of each other&#8217;s presence.
Never since have I walked between the school-house and
Thrums in so short a time, nor seen so little on the way.</p>
<p>In the Egyptian&#8217;s eyes, I suppose, was a picture of
Gavin lying dead; but if her grief had killed her thinking
faculties, mine, that was only less keen because I
had been struck down once before, had set all the
wheels of my brain in action. For it seemed to me
that the hour had come when I must disclose myself
to Margaret.</p>
<p>I had realised always that if such a necessity did arise
it could only be caused by Gavin&#8217;s premature death, or
by his proving a bad son to her. Some may wonder
that I could have looked calmly thus far into the possible,
but I reply that the night of Adam Dishart&#8217;s homecoming
had made of me a man whom the future could
not surprise again. Though I saw Gavin and his
mother happy in our Auld Licht manse, that did not
prevent my considering the contingencies which might
leave her without a son. In the school-house I had
brooded over them as one may think over moves on a
draught-board. It may have been idle, but it was done
that I might know how to act best for Margaret if anything
untoward occurred. The time for such action
had come. Gavin&#8217;s death had struck me hard, but it
did not crush me. I was not unprepared. I was going
to Margaret now.</p>
<p>What did I see as I walked quickly along the glen
road, with Babbie silent by my side, and I doubt not
pods of the broom cracking all around us? I saw myself
entering the Auld Licht manse, where Margaret sat
weeping over the body of Gavin, and there was none to
break my coming to her, for none but she and I knew
what had been.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>I saw my Margaret again, so fragile now, so thin the
wrists, her hair turned grey. No nearer could I go,
but stopped at the door, grieving for her, and at last
saying her name aloud.</p>
<p>I saw her raise her face, and look upon me for the
first time for eighteen years. She did not scream at
sight of me, for the body of her son lay between us, and
bridged the gulf that Adam Dishart had made.</p>
<p>I saw myself draw near her reverently and say,
&#8220;Margaret, he is dead, and that is why I have come
back,&#8221; and I saw her put her arms around my neck as
she often did long ago.</p>
<p>But it was not to be. Never since that night at
Harvie have I spoken to Margaret.</p>
<p>The Egyptian and I were to come to Windyghoul before
I heard her speak. She was not addressing me.
Here Gavin and she had met first, and she was talking
of that meeting to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was there,&#8221; I heard her say softly, as she gazed
at the bush beneath which she had seen him shaking
his fist at her on the night of the riots. A little farther
on she stopped where a path from Windyghoul sets off
for the well in the wood. She looked up it wistfully,
and there I left her behind, and pressed on to the mudhouse
to ask Nanny Webster if the minister was dead.
Nanny&#8217;s gate was swinging in the wind, but her door
was shut, and for a moment I stood at it like a coward,
afraid to enter and hear the worst.</p>
<p>The house was empty. I turned from it relieved,
as if I had got a respite, and while I stood in the garden
the Egyptian came to me shuddering, her twitching
face asking the question that would not leave her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no one in the house,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Nanny is
perhaps at the well.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the gypsy went inside, and pointing to the fire
said, &#8220;It has been out for hours. Do you not see? The
murder has drawn every one into Thrums.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></div>
<p>So I feared. A dreadful night was to pass before I
knew that this was the day of the release of Sanders
Webster, and that frail Nanny had walked into Tilliedrum
to meet him at the prison gate.</p>
<p>Babbie sank upon a stool, so weak that I doubt
whether she heard me tell her to wait there until my
return. I hurried into Thrums, not by the hill, though
it is the shorter way, but by the Roods, for I must hear
all before I ventured to approach the manse. From
Windyghoul to the top of the Roods it is a climb and
then a steep descent. The road has no sooner reached
its highest point than it begins to fall in the straight
line of houses called the Roods, and thus I came upon
a full view of the street at once. A cart was laboring
up it. There were women sitting on stones at their
doors, and girls playing at palaulays, and out of the
house nearest me came a black figure. My eyes failed
me; I was asking so much from them. They made
him tall and short, and spare and stout, so that I knew
it was Gavin, and yet, looking again, feared, but all
the time, I think, I knew it was he.</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Eight.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />THE HILL BEFORE DARKNESS FELL&mdash;SCENE OF THE IMPENDING CATASTROPHE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;You are better now?&#8221; I heard Gavin ask, presently.</p>
<p>He thought that having been taken ill suddenly I had
waved to him for help because he chanced to be near.
With all my wits about me I might have left him in
that belief, for rather would I have deceived him than
had him wonder why his welfare seemed so vital to me.
But I, who thought the capacity for being taken aback
had gone from me, clung to his arm and thanked God
audibly that he still lived. He did not tell me then
how my agitation puzzled him, but led me kindly to
the hill, where we could talk without listeners. By the
time we reached it I was again wary, and I had told
him what had brought me to Thrums, without mentioning
how the story of his death reached my ears, or
through whom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. McKenzie,&#8221; he said, interrupting me, &#8220;galloped
all the way from the Spittal on the same errand. However,
no one has been hurt much, except the piper himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he told me how the rumor arose.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know of the incident at the Spittal, and that
Campbell marched off in high dudgeon? I understand
that he spoke to no one between the Spittal and Thrums,
but by the time he arrived here he was more communicative;
yes, and thirstier. He was treated to drink in
several public-houses by persons who wanted to hear
his story, and by-and-by he began to drop hints of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
knowing something against the earl&#8217;s bride. Do you
know Rob Dow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;and what you have done for
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, sir!&#8221; he said, sighing, &#8220;for a long time I thought
I was to be God&#8217;s instrument in making a better man
of Rob, but my power over him went long ago. Ten
short months of the ministry takes some of the vanity
out of a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking sideways at him I was startled by the unnatural
brightness of his eyes. Unconsciously he had
acquired the habit of pressing his teeth together in the
pauses of his talk, shutting them on some woe that
would proclaim itself, as men do who keep their misery
to themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few hours ago,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I heard Rob&#8217;s voice
in altercation as I passed the Bull tavern, and I had
a feeling that if I failed with him so should I fail
always throughout my ministry. I walked into the
public-house, and stopped at the door of a room in
which Dow and the piper were sitting drinking. I
heard Rob saying, fiercely, &#8217;If what you say about her
is true, Highlandman, she&#8217;s the woman I&#8217;ve been looking
for this half year and mair; what is she like?&#8217; I
guessed, from what I had been told of the piper, that
they were speaking of the earl&#8217;s bride; but Rob saw me
and came to an abrupt stop, saying to his companion,
&#8216;Dinna say another word about her afore the minister.&#8217;
Rob would have come away at once in answer to my
appeal, but the piper was drunk and would not be
silenced. &#8216;I&#8217;ll tell the minister about her, too,&#8217; he
began. &#8216;You dinna ken what you&#8217;re doing,&#8217; Rob
roared, and then, as if to save my ears from scandal at
any cost, he struck Campbell a heavy blow on the
mouth. I tried to intercept the blow, with the result
that I fell, and then some one ran out of the tavern
crying, &#8216;He&#8217;s killed!&#8217; The piper had been stunned,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
but the story went abroad that he had stabbed me for
interfering with him. That is really all. Nothing, as
you know, can overtake an untruth if it has a minute&#8217;s
start.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Campbell now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleeping off the effect of the blow: but Dow has
fled. He was terrified at the shouts of murder, and ran
off up the West Town end. The doctor&#8217;s dogcart was
standing at a door there and Rob jumped into it and
drove off. They did not chase him far, because he is
sure to hear the truth soon, and then, doubtless, he will
come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though in a few hours we were to wonder at our
denseness, neither Gavin nor I saw why Dow had struck
the Highlander down rather than let him tell his story
in the minister&#8217;s presence. One moment&#8217;s suspicion
would have lit our way to the whole truth, but of the
spring to all Rob&#8217;s behavior in the past eight months
we were ignorant, and so to Gavin the Bull had only
been the scene of a drunken brawl, while I forgot to
think in the joy of finding him alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a prayer-meeting for rain presently,&#8221; Gavin
said, breaking a picture that had just appeared unpleasantly
before me of Babbie still in agony at Nanny&#8217;s,
&#8220;but before I leave you tell me why this rumor caused
you such distress.&#8221;</p>
<p>The question troubled me, and I tried to avoid it.
Crossing the hill we had by this time drawn near a
hollow called the Toad&#8217;s-hole, then gay and noisy with
a caravan of gypsies. They were those same wild
Lindsays, for whom Gavin had searched Caddam one
eventful night, and as I saw them crowding round their
king, a man well known to me, I guessed what they
were at.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dishart,&#8221; I said abruptly, &#8220;would you like to
see a gypsy marriage? One is taking place there just
now. That big fellow is the king, and he is about to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
marry two of his people over the tongs. The ceremony
will not detain us five minutes, though the rejoicings
will go on all night.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have been present at more than one gypsy wedding
in my time, and at the wild, weird orgies that followed
them, but what is interesting to such as I may not be
for a minister&#8217;s eyes, and, frowning at my proposal,
Gavin turned his back upon the Toad&#8217;s-hole. Then,
as we recrossed the hill, to get away from the din of
the camp, I pointed out to him that the report of his
death had brought McKenzie to Thrums, as well as me.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as McKenzie heard I was not dead,&#8221; he
answered, &#8220;he galloped off to the Spittal, without even
seeing me. I suppose he posted back to be in time for
the night&#8217;s rejoicings there. So you see, it was not
solicitude for me that brought him. He came because
a servant at the Spittal was supposed to have done the
deed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; I had to say, &#8220;why should I
deny that I have a warm regard for you? You have
done brave work in our town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been little,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;With God&#8217;s help
it will be more in future.&#8221;</p>
<p>He meant that he had given time to his sad love
affair that he owed to his people. Of seeing Babbie
again I saw that he had given up hope. Instead of repining,
he was devoting his whole soul to God&#8217;s work.
I was proud of him, and yet I grieved, for I could not
think that God wanted him to bury his youth so soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had thought,&#8221; he confessed to me, &#8220;that you were
one of those who did not like my preaching.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were mistaken,&#8221; I said, gravely. I dared not
tell him that, except his mother, none would have sat
under him so eagerly as I.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you were a member of the
Auld Licht church in Mr. Carfrae&#8217;s time, and you left
it when I came.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I heard your first sermon,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I had not been long in Thrums
before I discovered that if I took tea with any of my
congregation and declined a second cup, they thought
it a reflection on their brewing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not look upon my absence in that light,&#8221;
was all I could say. &#8220;There are reasons why I cannot
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not press me further, thinking I meant that
the distance was too great, though frailer folk than I
walked twenty miles to hear him. We might have
parted thus had we not wandered by chance to the very
spot where I had met him and Babbie. There is a seat
there now for those who lose their breath on the climb
up, and so I have two reasons nowadays for not passing
the place by.</p>
<p>We read each other&#8217;s thoughts, and Gavin said
calmly, &#8220;I have not seen her since that night. She
disappeared as into a grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>How could I answer when I knew that Babbie was
dying for want of him, not half a mile away?</p>
<p>&#8220;You seemed to understand everything that night,&#8221;
he went on; &#8220;or if you did not, your thoughts were very
generous to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>In my sorrow for him I did not notice that we were
moving on again, this time in the direction of Windyghoul.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was only a gypsy girl,&#8221; he said, abruptly, and
I nodded. &#8220;But I hoped,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that she
would be my wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understood that,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was nothing monstrous to you,&#8221; he asked,
looking me in the face, &#8220;in a minister&#8217;s marrying a
gypsy?&#8221;</p>
<p>I own that if I had loved a girl, however far below
or above me in degree, I would have married her had
she been willing to take me. But to Gavin I only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
answered, &#8220;These are matters a man must decide for
himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had decided for myself,&#8221; he said, emphatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet,&#8221; I said, wanting him to talk to me of Margaret,
&#8220;in such a case one might have others to consider besides
himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s marriage,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;is his own affair,
I would have brooked no interference from my congregation.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought, &#8220;There is some obstinacy left in him still;&#8221;
but aloud I said, &#8220;It was of your mother I was thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She would have taken Babbie to her heart,&#8221; he said,
with the fond conviction of a lover.</p>
<p>I doubted it, but I only asked, &#8220;Your mother knows
nothing of her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; he rejoined. &#8220;It would be cruelty to tell
my mother of her now that she is gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin&#8217;s calmness had left him, and he was striding
quickly nearer to Windyghoul. I was in dread lest he
should see the Egyptian at Nanny&#8217;s door, yet to have
turned him in another direction might have roused his
suspicions. When we were within a hundred yards of
the mudhouse, I knew that there was no Babbie in
sight. We halved the distance and then I saw her at
the open window. Gavin&#8217;s eyes were on the ground,
but she saw him. I held my breath, fearing that she
would run out to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have never seen her since that night?&#8221; Gavin
asked me, without hope in his voice.</p>
<p>Had he been less hopeless he would have wondered
why I did not reply immediately. I was looking covertly
at the mudhouse, of which we were now within a few
yards. Babbie&#8217;s face had gone from the window, and
the door remained shut. That she could hear every
word we uttered now, I could not doubt. But she was
hiding from the man for whom her soul longed. She
was sacrificing herself for him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; I answered, notwithstanding my pity of
the brave girl, and then while I was shaking lest he
should go in to visit Nanny, I heard the echo of the
Auld Licht bell.</p>
<p>&#8220;That calls me to the meeting for rain,&#8221; Gavin said,
bidding me good-night. I had acted for Margaret, and
yet I had hardly the effrontery to take his hand. I
suppose he saw sympathy in my face, for suddenly the
cry broke from him&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could only know that nothing evil had befallen
her!&#8221;</p>
<p>Babbie heard him and could not restrain a heart-breaking
sob.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; he said, starting.</p>
<p>A moment I waited, to let her show herself if she
chose. But the mudhouse was silent again.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was some boy in the wood,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; he said, trying to smile.</p>
<p>Had I let him go, here would have been the end of
his love story, but that piteous smile unmanned me, and
I could not keep the words back.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is in Nanny&#8217;s house,&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>In another moment these two were together for weal
or woe, and I had set off dizzily for the school-house,
feeling now that I had been false to Margaret, and again
exulting in what I had done. By and by the bell
stopped, and Gavin and Babbie regarded it as little as
I heeded the burns now crossing the glen road noisily
at places that had been dry two hours before.</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Nine.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />STORY OF THE EGYPTIAN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>God gives us more than, were we not overbold, we
should dare to ask for, and yet how often (perhaps after
saying &#8220;Thank God&#8221; so curtly that it is only a form of
swearing) we are suppliants again within the hour.
Gavin was to be satisfied if he were told that no evil had
befallen her he loved, and all the way between the
school-house and Windyghoul Babbie craved for no
more than Gavin&#8217;s life. Now they had got their desires;
but do you think they were content?</p>
<p>The Egyptian had gone on her knees when she heard
Gavin speak of her. It was her way of preventing herself
from running to him. Then, when she thought him
gone, he opened the door. She rose and shrank back,
but first she had stepped toward him with a glad cry.
His disappointed arms met on nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, too, heard that I was dead?&#8221; he said, thinking
her strangeness but grief too sharply turned to joy.</p>
<p>There were tears in the word with which she answered
him, and he would have kissed her, but she defended
her face with her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Babbie,&#8221; he asked, beginning to fear that he
had not sounded her deepest woe, &#8220;why have you
left me all this time? You are not glad to see me
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was glad,&#8221; she answered in a low voice, &#8220;to see
you from the window, but I prayed to God not to let
you see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She even pulled away her hand when he would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
taken it. &#8220;No, no, I am to tell you everything now,
and then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say that you love me first,&#8221; he broke in, when a
sob checked her speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I must tell you first what I have
done, and then you will not ask me to say that. I am
not a gypsy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What of that?&#8221; cried Gavin. &#8220;It was not because
you were a gypsy that I loved you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the last time you will say you love me,&#8221; said
Babbie. &#8220;Mr. Dishart, I am to be married to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped, afraid to say more lest he should fall,
but except that his arms twitched he did not move.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am to be married to Lord Rintoul,&#8221; she went on.
&#8220;Now you know who I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned from him, for his piercing eyes frightened
her. Never again, she knew, would she see the love-light
in them. He plucked himself from the spot
where he had stood looking at her and walked to the
window. When he wheeled round there was no anger on
his face, only a pathetic wonder that he had been deceived
so easily. It was at himself that he was smiling
grimly rather than at her, and the change pained
Babbie as no words could have hurt her. He sat down
on a chair and waited for her to go on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look at me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I will tell you
everything.&#8221; He dropped his eyes listlessly, and had
he not asked her a question from time to time, she would
have doubted whether he heard her.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; she said, &#8220;a gypsy dress is my birth-right,
and so the Thrums people were scarcely wrong in
calling me an Egyptian. It is a pity any one insisted
on making me something different. I believe I could
have been a good gypsy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who were your parents?&#8221; Gavin asked, without
looking up.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ask that,&#8221; she said, &#8220;because you have a good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
mother. It is not a question that would occur to me.
My mother&mdash;If she was bad, may not that be some
excuse for me? Ah, but I have no wish to excuse myself.
Have you seen a gypsy cart with a sort of hammock
swung beneath it in which gypsy children are
carried about the country? If there are no children,
the pots and pans are stored in it. Unless the roads
are rough it makes a comfortable cradle, and it was the
only one I ever knew. Well, one day I suppose the
road was rough, for I was capsized. I remember picking
myself up after a little and running after the cart,
but they did not hear my cries. I sat down by the roadside
and stared after the cart until I lost sight of it.
That was in England, and I was not three years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely,&#8221; Gavin said, &#8220;they came back to look
for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So far as I know,&#8221; Babbie answered hardly, &#8220;they
did not come back. I have never seen them since. I
think they were drunk. My only recollection of my
mother is that she once took me to see the dead body
of some gypsy who had been murdered. She told me
to dip my hand in the blood, so that I could say I had
done so when I became a woman. It was meant as a
treat to me, and is the one kindness I am sure I got from
her. Curiously enough, I felt the shame of her deserting
me for many years afterwards. As a child I cried
hysterically at thought of it; it pained me when I was
at school in Edinburgh every time I saw the other girls
writing home; I cannot think of it without a shudder
even now. It is what makes me worse than other
women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice had altered, and she was speaking passionately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; she continued, more gently, &#8220;I try to
think that my mother did come back for me, and then
went away because she heard I was in better hands than
hers. It was Lord Rintoul who found me, and I owe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
everything to him. You will say that he has no need to
be proud of me. He took me home on his horse, and
paid his gardener&#8217;s wife to rear me. She was Scotch,
and that is why I can speak two languages. It was he,
too, who sent me to school in Edinburgh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been very kind to you,&#8221; said Gavin, who
would have preferred to dislike the earl.</p>
<p>&#8220;So kind,&#8221; answered Babbie, &#8220;that now he is to
marry me. But do you know why he has done all
this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now again she was agitated, and spoke indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all because I have a pretty face,&#8221; she said, her
bosom rising and falling. &#8220;Men think of nothing else.
He had no pity for the deserted child. I knew that
while I was yet on his horse. When he came to the
gardener&#8217;s afterwards, it was not to give me some one
to love, it was only to look upon what was called my
beauty; I was merely a picture to him, and even the
gardener&#8217;s children knew it and sought to terrify me
by saying, &#8216;You are losing your looks; the earl will not
care for you any more.&#8217; Sometimes he brought his
friends to see me, &#8216;because I was such a lovely child,&#8217;
and if they did not agree with him on that point he
left without kissing me. Throughout my whole girlhood
I was taught nothing but to please him, and the
only way to do that was to be pretty. It was the only
virtue worth striving for; the others were never thought
of when he asked how I was getting on. Once I had
fever and nearly died, yet this knowledge that my face
was everything was implanted in me so that my fear
lest he should think me ugly when I recovered terrified
me into hysterics. I dream still that I am in that fever
and all my fears return. He did think me ugly when
he saw me next. I remember the incident so well still.
I had run to him, and he was lifting me up to kiss me
when he saw that my face had changed. &#8216;What a cruel
disappointment,&#8217; he said, and turned his back on me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
I had given him a child&#8217;s love until then, but from that
day I was hard and callous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when was it you became beautiful again?&#8221;
Gavin asked, by no means in the mind to pay compliments.</p>
<p>&#8220;A year passed,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;before I saw him
again. In that time he had not asked for me once, and
the gardener had kept me out of charity. It was by an
accident that we met, and at first he did not know me.
Then he said, &#8216;Why, Babbie, I believe you are to be a
beauty, after all!&#8217; I hated him for that, and stalked
away from him, but he called after me, &#8216;Bravo! she
walks like a queen&#8217;; and it was because I walked like a
queen that he sent me to an Edinburgh school. He
used to come to see me every year, and as I grew up
the girls called me Lady Rintoul. He was not fond of
me; he is not fond of me now. He would as soon think
of looking at the back of a picture as at what I am
apart from my face, but he dotes on it, and is to marry
it. Is that love? Long before I left school, which was
shortly before you came to Thrums, he had told his sister
that he was determined to marry me, and she hated
me for it, making me as uncomfortable as she could, so
that I almost looked forward to the marriage because it
would be such a humiliation to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>In admitting this she looked shamefacedly at Gavin,
and then went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is humiliating him too. I understand him. He
would like not to want to marry me, for he is ashamed
of my origin, but he cannot help it. It is this feeling
that has brought him here, so that the marriage may
take place where my history is not known.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The secret has been well kept,&#8221; Gavin said, &#8220;for
they have failed to discover it even in Thrums.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the Spittal servants suspect it, nevertheless,&#8221;
Babbie answered, &#8220;though how much they know
I cannot say. He has not a servant now, either here or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
in England, who knew me as a child. The gardener
who befriended me was sent away long ago. Lord
Rintoul looks upon me as a disgrace to him that he
cannot live without.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say he cares for you more than you think,&#8221;
Gavin said gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is infatuated about my face, or the pose of my
head, or something of that sort,&#8221; Babbie said bitterly,
&#8220;or he would not have endured me so long. I have
twice had the wedding postponed, chiefly, I believe, to
enrage my natural enemy, his sister, who is as much aggravated
by my reluctance to marry him as by his desire
to marry me. However, I also felt that imprisonment
for life was approaching as the day drew near, and I
told him that if he did not defer the wedding I should
run away. He knows I am capable of it, for twice I
ran away from school. If his sister only knew that!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment it was the old Babbie Gavin saw; but
her glee was short-lived, and she resumed sedately:</p>
<p>&#8220;They were kind to me at school, but the life was so
dull and prim that I ran off in a gypsy dress of my
own making. That is what it is to have gypsy blood
in one. I was away for a week the first time, wandering
the country alone, telling fortunes, dancing and
singing in woods, and sleeping in barns. I am the only
woman in the world well brought up who is not afraid
of mice or rats. That is my gypsy blood again. After
that wild week I went back to the school of my own
will, and no one knows of the escapade but my schoolmistress
and Lord Rintoul. The second time, however,
I was detected singing in the street, and then my future
husband was asked to take me away. Yet Miss
Feversham cried when I left, and told me that I was
the nicest girl she knew, as well as the nastiest. She
said she should love me as soon as I was not one of her
boarders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then you came to the Spittal?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and Lord Rintoul wanted me to say I was
sorry for what I had done, but I told him I need not
say that, for I was sure to do it again. As you know,
I have done it several times since then; and though I
am a different woman since I knew you, I dare say I
shall go on doing it at times all my life. You shake
your head because you do not understand. It is not
that I make up my mind to break out in that way; I
may not have had the least desire to do it for weeks,
and then suddenly, when I am out riding, or at dinner,
or at a dance, the craving to be a gypsy again is so
strong that I never think of resisting it; I would risk
my life to gratify it. Yes, whatever my life in the
future is to be, I know that must be a part of it. I used
to pretend at the Spittal that I had gone to bed, and
then escape by the window. I was mad with glee at
those times, but I always returned before morning, except
once, the last time I saw you, when I was away
for nearly twenty-four hours. Lord Rintoul was so
glad to see me come back then that he almost forgave
me for going away. There is nothing more to tell except
that on the night of the riot it was not my gypsy
nature that brought me to Thrums, but a desire to save
the poor weavers. I had heard Lord Rintoul and the
sheriff discussing the contemplated raid. I have hidden
nothing from you. In time, perhaps, I shall have
suffered sufficiently for all my wickedness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin rose weariedly, and walked through the mudhouse
looking at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the end of it all,&#8221; he said harshly, coming
to a standstill. &#8220;I loved you, Babbie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered, shaking her head. &#8220;You never
knew me until now, and so it was not me you loved.
I know what you thought I was, and I will try to be it
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had only told me this before,&#8221; the minister
said sadly, &#8220;it might not have been too late.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I only thought you like all the other men I knew,&#8221;
she replied, &#8220;until the night I came to the manse. It
was only my face you admired at first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it was never that,&#8221; Gavin said with such conviction
that her mouth opened in alarm to ask him if
he did not think her pretty. She did not speak, however,
and he continued, &#8220;You must have known that I
loved you from the first night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; you only amused me,&#8221; she said, like one determined
to stint nothing of the truth. &#8220;Even at the
well I laughed at your vows.&#8221;</p>
<p>This wounded Gavin afresh, wretched as her story
had made him, and he said tragically, &#8220;You have
never cared for me at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, always, always,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;since I knew
what love was; and it was you who taught me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even in his misery he held his head high with pride.
At least she did love him.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; Babbie said, hiding her face, &#8220;I could
not tell you what I was because I knew you would
loathe me. I could only go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him forlornly through her tears, and
then moved toward the door. He had sunk upon a
stool, his face resting on the table, and it was her intention
to slip away unnoticed. But he heard the latch
rise, and jumping up, said sharply, &#8220;Babbie, I cannot
give you up.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood in tears, swinging the door unconsciously
with her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that you love me still,&#8221; she cried; and
then, letting her hand fall from the door, added imploringly,
&#8220;Oh, Gavin, do you?&#8221;</p>

<h2>Chapter Thirty.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />THE MEETING FOR RAIN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Meanwhile the Auld Lichts were in church, waiting
for their minister, and it was a full meeting, because
nearly every well in Thrums had been scooped dry by
anxious palms. Yet not all were there to ask God&#8217;s
rain for themselves. Old Charles Yuill was in his pew,
after dreaming thrice that he would break up with the
drought; and Bell Christison had come, though her
man lay dead at home, and she thought it could matter
no more to her how things went in the world.</p>
<p>You, who do not love that little congregation, would
have said that they were waiting placidly. But probably
so simple a woman as Meggy Rattray could have
deceived you into believing that because her eyes were
downcast she did not notice who put the three-penny-bit
in the plate. A few men were unaware that the
bell was working overtime, most of them farmers with
their eyes on the windows, but all the women at least
were wondering. They knew better, however, than
to bring their thoughts to their faces, and none sought
to catch another&#8217;s eye. The men-folk looked heavily
at their hats in the seats in front. Even when Hendry
Munn, instead of marching to the pulpit with the big
Bible in his hands, came as far as the plate and signed
to Peter Tosh, elder, that he was wanted in the vestry,
you could not have guessed how every woman there,
except Bell Christison, wished she was Peter Tosh.
Peter was so taken aback that he merely gaped at
Hendry, until suddenly he knew that his five daughters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
were furious with him, when he dived for his hat and
staggered to the vestry with his mouth open. His
boots cheeped all the way, but no one looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadna noticed the minister was lang in coming,&#8221;
Waster Lunny told me afterward, &#8220;but Elspeth noticed
it, and with a quickness that baffles me she saw I
was thinking o&#8217; other things. So she let out her foot
at me. I gae a low cough to let her ken I wasna sleeping,
but in a minute out goes her foot again. Ay,
syne I thocht I micht hae dropped my hanky into
Snecky Hobart&#8217;s pew, but no, it was in my tails. Yet
her hand was on the board, and she was working her
fingers in a way that I kent meant she would like to
shake me. Next I looked to see if I was sitting on her
frock, the which tries a woman sair, but I wasna.
&#8216;Does she want to change Bibles wi&#8217; me?&#8217; I wondered;
&#8216;or is she sliding yont a peppermint to me?&#8217; It was
neither, so I edged as far frae her as I could gang.
Weel, would you credit it, I saw her body coming
nearer me inch by inch, though she was looking
straucht afore her, till she was within kick o&#8217; me, and
then out again goes her foot. At that, dominie, I lost
patience, and I whispered, fierce-like, &#8216;Keep your foot
to yoursel&#8217;, you limmer!&#8217; Ay, her intent, you see, was
to waken me to what was gaen on, but I couldna be
expected to ken that.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the vestry Hendry Munn was now holding counsel
with three elders, of whom the chief was Lang
Tammas.</p>
<p>&#8220;The laddie I sent to the manse,&#8221; Hendry said,
&#8220;canna be back this five minutes, and the question is
how we&#8217;re to fill up that time. I&#8217;ll ring no langer, for
the bell has been in a passion ever since a quarter-past
eight. It&#8217;s as sweer to clang past the quarter as a
horse to gallop by its stable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could gang to your box and gie out a psalm,
Tammas,&#8221; suggested John Spens.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And would a psalm sung wi&#8217; sic an object,&#8221; retorted
the precentor, &#8220;mount higher, think you, than a
bairn&#8217;s kite? I&#8217;ll insult the Almighty to screen no
minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re screening him better by standing whaur you
are,&#8221; said the imperturbable Hendry; &#8220;for as lang as
you dinna show your face they&#8217;ll think it may be you
that&#8217;s missing instead o&#8217; Mr. Dishart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, Gavin&#8217;s appearance in church without the
precentor would have been as surprising as Tammas&#8217;s
without the minister. As certainly as the shutting of
a money-box is followed by the turning of the key, did
the precentor walk stiffly from the vestry to his box a
toll of the bell in front of the minister. Tammas&#8217;s
halfpenny rang in the plate as Gavin passed T&#8217;nowhead&#8217;s
pew, and Gavin&#8217;s sixpence with the snapping-to
of the precentor&#8217;s door. The two men might have been
connected by a string that tightened at ten yards.</p>
<p>&#8220;The congregation ken me ower weel,&#8221; Tammas said,
&#8220;to believe I would keep the Lord waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they are as sure o&#8217; Mr. Dishart,&#8221; rejoined
Spens, with spirit, though he feared the precentor on
Sabbaths and at prayer-meetings. &#8220;You&#8217;re a hard
man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I speak the blunt truth,&#8221; Whamond answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said Spens, &#8220;and to tak&#8217; credit for that may
be like blawing that you&#8217;re ower honest to wear
claethes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hendry, who had gone to the door, returned now
with the information that Mr. Dishart had left the
manse two hours ago to pay visits, meaning to come to
the prayer-meeting before he returned home.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a quirk in this, Hendry,&#8221; said Tosh.
&#8220;Was it Mistress Dishart the laddie saw?&#8221;</p>

&#8220;THE CONSULTATION OF THE ELDERS.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Hendry replied. &#8220;It was Jean. She canna
get to the meeting because the mistress is nervous in
the manse by herself; and Jean didna like to tell her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
that he&#8217;s missing, for fear o&#8217; alarming her. What are
we to do now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an unfaithful shepherd,&#8221; cried the precentor,
while Hendry again went out. &#8220;I see it written on the
walls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna,&#8221; said Spens doggedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; retorted Tammas, &#8220;having eyes you see
not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tammas, I aye thocht you was fond o&#8217; Mr. Dishart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If my right eye were to offend me,&#8221; answered the
precentor, &#8220;I would pluck it out. I suppose you think,
and baith o&#8217; you farmers too, that there&#8217;s no necessity
for praying for rain the nicht? You&#8217;ll be content, will
ye, if Mr. Dishart just drops in to the kirk some day,
accidental-like, and offers up a bit prayer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As for the rain,&#8221; Spens said, triumphantly, &#8220;I
wouldna wonder though it&#8217;s here afore the minister.
You canna deny, Peter Tosh, that there&#8217;s been a smell
o&#8217; rain in the air this twa hours back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; Peter said agitatedly, &#8220;dinna speak so confidently.
I&#8217;ve kent it,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;since the day
turned; but it wants to tak&#8217; us by surprise, lad, and so
I&#8217;m no letting on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See that you dinna make an idol o&#8217; the rain,&#8221; thundered
Whamond. &#8220;Your thochts is no wi&#8217; Him, but
wi&#8217; the clouds; and whaur your thochts are, there will
your prayers stick also.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you saw my lambs,&#8221; Tosh began; and then,
ashamed of himself, said, looking upward, &#8220;He holds
the rain in the hollow of His hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And He&#8217;s closing His neive ticht on&#8217;t again,&#8221; said
the precentor solemnly. &#8220;Hearken to the wind rising!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God help me!&#8221; cried Tosh, wringing his hands.
&#8220;Is it fair, think you,&#8221; he said, passionately addressing
the sky, &#8220;to show your wrath wi&#8217; Mr. Dishart by ruining
my neeps?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were richt, Tammas Whamond,&#8221; Spens said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
growing hard as he listened to the wind, &#8220;the sanctuary
o&#8217; the Lord has been profaned this nicht by him wha
should be the chief pillar o&#8217; the building.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were lowering brows that greeted Hendry when
he returned to say that Mr. Dishart had been seen last
on the hill with the Glen Quharity dominie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some thinks,&#8221; said the kirk officer, &#8220;that he&#8217;s awa
hunting for Rob Dow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&#8217;ll excuse him,&#8221; replied Spens, &#8220;short o&#8217;
his having fallen over the quarry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hendry&#8217;s was usually a blank face, but it must have
looked troubled now, for Tosh was about to say,
&#8220;Hendry, you&#8217;re keeping something back,&#8221; when the
precentor said it before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wi&#8217; that story o&#8217; Mr. Dishart&#8217;s murder, no many
hours auld yet,&#8221; the kirk officer replied evasively, &#8220;we
should be wary o&#8217; trusting gossip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What hae you heard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s through the town,&#8221; Hendry answered, &#8220;that a
woman was wi&#8217; the dominie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman!&#8221; cried Tosh. &#8220;The woman there&#8217;s been
sic talk about in connection wi&#8217; the minister? Whaur
are they now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no kent, but&mdash;the dominie was seen goin&#8217; hame
by himsel&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leaving the minister and her thegither!&#8221; cried the
three men at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hendry Munn,&#8221; Tammas said sternly, &#8220;there&#8217;s
mair about this; wha is the woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are liars,&#8221; Hendry answered, and shut his
mouth tight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gie her a name, I say,&#8221; the precentor ordered, &#8220;or,
as chief elder of this kirk, supported by mair than
half o&#8217; the Session, I command you to lift your hat
and go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hendry gave an appealing look to Tosh and Spens,
but the precentor&#8217;s solemnity had cowed them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></div>
<p>&#8220;They say, then,&#8221; he answered sullenly, &#8220;that it&#8217;s
the Egyptian. Yes, and I believe they ken.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two farmers drew back from this statement incredulously;
but Tammas Whamond jumped at the
kirk officer&#8217;s throat, and some who were in the church
that night say they heard Hendry scream. Then the
precentor&#8217;s fingers relaxed their grip, and he tottered
into the middle of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hendry,&#8221; he pleaded, holding out his arms pathetically,
&#8220;tak&#8217; back these words. Oh, man, have pity,
and tak&#8217; them back!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Hendry would not, and then Lang Tammas&#8217;s
mouth worked convulsively, and he sobbed, crying,
&#8220;Nobody kent it, but mair than mortal son, O God, I
did love the lad!&#8221;</p>
<p>So seldom in a lifetime had any one seen into this
man&#8217;s heart that Spens said, amazed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tammas, Tammas Whamond, it&#8217;s no like you to
break down.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rusty door of Whamond&#8217;s heart swung to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who broke down?&#8221; he asked fiercely. &#8220;Let no
member of this Session dare to break down till his
work be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What work?&#8221; Tosh said uneasily. &#8220;We canna interfere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would rather resign,&#8221; Spens said, but shook when
Whamond hurled these words at him:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his
hand to the plough and looking back, is fit for the kingdom
of God.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It mayna be true,&#8221; Hendry said eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would gie her up,&#8221; said Tosh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter Tosh,&#8221; answered Whamond sternly, &#8220;I call
upon you to dismiss the congregation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Should we no rather haud the meeting oursel&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have other work afore us,&#8221; replied the precentor.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But what can I say?&#8221; Tosh asked nervously.
&#8220;Should I offer up a prayer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I warn you all,&#8221; broke in Hendry, &#8220;that though the
congregation is sitting there quietly, they&#8217;ll be tigers
for the meaning o&#8217; this as soon as they&#8217;re in the street.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let no ontruth be telled them,&#8221; said the precentor.
&#8220;Peter Tosh, do your duty. John Spens, remain wi&#8217;
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The church emptied silently, but a buzz of excitement
arose outside. Many persons tried to enter the
vestry, but were ordered away, and when Tosh joined
his fellow-elders the people were collecting in animated
groups in the square, or scattering through the wynds
for news.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said the precentor, &#8220;I call upon the
three o&#8217; you to come wi&#8217; me. Hendry Munn, you gang
first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I maun bide ahint,&#8221; Hendry said, with a sudden
fear, &#8220;to lock up the kirk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lock up the kirk,&#8221; Whamond answered harshly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You maun gie me the keys, though,&#8221; entreated the
kirk officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take care o&#8217; the keys,&#8221; said Whamond.</p>
<p>&#8220;I maun hae them,&#8221; Hendry said, &#8220;to open the kirk
on Sabbath.&#8221;</p>
<p>The precentor locked the doors, and buttoned up the
keys in his trousers pockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha kens,&#8221; he said, in a voice of steel, &#8220;that the
kirk&#8217;ll be open next Sabbath?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hae some mercy on him, Tammas,&#8221; Spens implored.
&#8220;He&#8217;s no twa-and-twenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha kens,&#8221; continued the precentor, &#8220;but that the
next time this kirk is opened will be to preach it toom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What road do we tak&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The road to the hill, whaur he was seen last.&#8221;</p>

<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />VARIOUS BODIES CONVERGING ON THE HILL.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>It would be coming on for a quarter-past nine, and
a misty night, when I reached the school-house, and I
was so weary of mind and body that I sat down without
taking off my bonnet. I had left the door open, and I
remember listlessly watching the wind making a target
of my candle, but never taking a sufficiently big breath
to do more than frighten it. From this lethargy I was
roused by the sound of wheels.</p>
<p>In the daytime our glen road leads to many parts,
but in the night only to the doctor&#8217;s. Then the gallop
of a horse makes farmers start up in bed and cry,
&#8220;Who&#8217;s ill?&#8221; I went to my door and listened to the
trap coming swiftly down the lonely glen, but I could
not see it, for there was a trailing scarf of mist between
the school-house and the road. Presently I heard the
swish of the wheels in water, and so learned that they
were crossing the ford to come to me. I had been unstrung
by the events of the evening, and fear at once
pressed thick upon me that this might be a sequel to
them, as indeed it was.</p>
<p>While still out of sight the trap stopped, and I heard
some one jump from it. Then came this conversation,
as distinct as though it had been spoken into my ear:</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you see the school-house now, McKenzie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am groping for it, Rintoul. The mist seems to
have made off with the path.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you, McKenzie? I have lost sight of
you.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></div>
<p>It was but a ribbon of mist, and as these words were
spoken McKenzie broke through it. I saw him, though
to him I was only a stone at my door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have found the house, Rintoul,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;and
there is a light in it, so that the fellow has doubtless
returned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then wait a moment for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay where you are, Rintoul, I entreat you, and
leave him to me. He may recognize you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, McKenzie, I am sure he never saw me before.
I insist on accompanying you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your excitement, Rintoul, will betray you. Let
me go alone. I can question him without rousing his
suspicions. Remember, she is only a gypsy to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will learn nothing from me. I am quite calm
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rintoul, I warn you your manner will betray you,
and to-morrow it will be roared through the countryside
that your bride ran away from the Spittal in a
gypsy dress, and had to be brought back by force.&#8221;</p>
<p>The altercation may have lasted another minute, but
the suddenness with which I learned Babbie&#8217;s secret
had left my ears incapable of learning more. I daresay
the two men started when they found me at my door,
but they did not remember, as few do remember who
have the noisy day to forget it in, how far the voice
carries in the night.</p>
<p>They came as suddenly on me as I on them, for
though they had given unintentional notice of their
approach, I had lost sight of the speakers in their amazing
words. Only a moment did young McKenzie&#8217;s
anxiety to be spokesman give me to regard Lord Rintoul.
I saw that he was a thin man and tall, straight
in the figure, but his head began to sink into his shoulders
and not very steady on them. His teeth had grip
of his under-lip, as if this was a method of controlling
his agitation, and he was opening and shutting his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
hands restlessly. He had a dog with him which I was
to meet again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well met, Mr. Ogilvy,&#8221; said McKenzie, who knew
me slightly, having once acted as judge at a cock-fight
in the school-house. &#8220;We were afraid we should have
to rouse you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will step inside?&#8221; I asked awkwardly, and
while I spoke I was wondering how long it would be
before the earl&#8217;s excitement broke out.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not necessary,&#8221; McKenzie answered hurriedly.
&#8220;My friend and I (this is Mr. McClure) have been
caught in the mist without a lamp, and we thought you
could perhaps favor us with one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately I have nothing of the kind,&#8221; I said,
and the state of mind I was in is shown by my answering
seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we must wish you a good-night and manage
as best we can,&#8221; he said; and then before he could
touch, with affected indifference, on the real object of
their visit, the alarmed earl said angrily, &#8220;McKenzie,
no more of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more of this delay, do you mean, McClure?&#8221;
asked McKenzie, and then, turning to me said, &#8220;By
the way, Mr. Ogilvy, I think this is our second meeting
to-night. I met you on the road a few hours ago with
your wife. Or was it your daughter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was neither, Mr. McKenzie,&#8221; I answered, with
the calmness of one not yet recovered from a shock.
&#8220;It was a gypsy girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is she now?&#8221; cried Rintoul feverishly; but
McKenzie, speaking loudly at the same time, tried to
drown his interference as one obliterates writing by
writing over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;A strange companion for a schoolmaster,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;What became of her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I left her near Caddam Wood,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;but she
is probably not there now.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ah, they are strange creatures, these gypsies!&#8221; he
said, casting a warning look at the earl. &#8220;Now I wonder
where she had been bound for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a gypsy encampment on the hill,&#8221; I answered,
though I cannot say why.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is there!&#8221; exclaimed Rintoul, and was done
with me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I daresay,&#8221; McKenzie said indifferently. &#8220;However,
it is nothing to us. Good-night, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>The earl had started for the trap, but McKenzie&#8217;s
salute reminded him of a forgotten courtesy, and, despite
his agitation, he came back to apologize. I admired
him for this. Then my thoughtlessness must
needs mar all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, Mr. McKenzie,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Good-night,
Lord Rintoul.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had addressed him by his real name. Never a turnip
fell from a bumping, laden cart, and the driver
more unconscious of it, than I that I had dropped that
word. I re-entered the house, but had not reached my
chair when McKenzie&#8217;s hand fell roughly on me, and I
was swung round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Ogilvy,&#8221; he said, the more savagely I doubt
not because his passions had been chained so long,
&#8220;you know more than you would have us think. Beware,
sir, of recognising that gypsy should you ever
see her again in different attire. I advise you to have
forgotten this night when you waken to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a menacing gesture he left me, and I sank into
a chair, glad to lose sight of the glowering eyes with
which he had pinned me to the wall. I did not hear
the trap cross the ford and renew its journey. When I
looked out next, the night had fallen very dark, and the
glen was so deathly in its drowsiness that I thought
not even the cry of murder could tear its eyes open.</p>
<p>The earl and McKenzie would be some distance still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
from the hill when the office-bearers had scoured it in
vain for their minister. The gypsies, now dancing
round their fires to music that, on ordinary occasions,
Lang Tammas would have stopped by using his fists to
the glory of God, had seen no minister, they said, and
disbelieved in the existence of the mysterious Egyptian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liars they are to trade,&#8221; Spens declared to his companions,
&#8220;but now and again they speak truth, like a
standing clock, and I&#8217;m beginning to think the minister&#8217;s
lassie was invented in the square.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so,&#8221; said the precentor, &#8220;for we saw her oursel&#8217;s
a short year syne, and Hendry Munn there allows
there&#8217;s townsfolk that hae passed her in the glen mair
recently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only allowed,&#8221; Hendry said cautiously, &#8220;that some
sic talk had shot up sudden-like in the town. Them
that pretends they saw her says that she joukit quick
out o&#8217; sicht.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, and there&#8217;s another quirk in that,&#8221; responded
the suspicious precentor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;se uphaud the minister&#8217;s sitting in the manse in
his slippers by this time,&#8221; Hendry said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing,&#8221; replied Whamond, &#8220;to gang back and
speir, or to search Caddam next; but let the matter
drop I winna, though I ken you&#8217;re a&#8217; awid to be hame
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And naturally,&#8221; retorted Tosh, &#8220;for the nicht&#8217;s
coming on as black as pick, and by the time we&#8217;re at
Caddam we&#8217;ll no even see the trees.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toward Caddam, nevertheless, they advanced, hearing
nothing but a distant wind and the whish of their
legs in the broom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whaur&#8217;s John Spens?&#8221; Hendry said suddenly.</p>
<p>They turned back and found Spens rooted to the
ground, as a boy becomes motionless when he thinks
he is within arm&#8217;s reach of a nest and the bird sitting
on the eggs.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What do you see, man?&#8221; Hendry whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;As sure as death,&#8221; answered Spens, awe-struck, &#8220;I
felt a drap o&#8217; rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no rain we&#8217;re here to look for,&#8221; said the precentor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter Tosh,&#8221; cried Spens, &#8220;it was a drap! Oh,
Peter! how are you looking at me so queer, Peter,
when you should be thanking the Lord for the promise
that&#8217;s in that drap?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come away,&#8221; Whamond said, impatiently; but
Spens answered, &#8220;No till I&#8217;ve offered up a prayer for
the promise that&#8217;s in that drap. Peter Tosh, you&#8217;ve
forgotten to take off your bonnet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think twice, John Spens,&#8221; gasped Tosh, &#8220;afore you
pray for rain this nicht.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others thought him crazy, but he went on, with
a catch in his voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt a drap o&#8217; rain mysel&#8217;, just afore it came on
dark so hurried, and my first impulse was to wish that
I could carry that drap about wi&#8217; me and look at it.
But, John Spens, when I looked up I saw sic a change
running ower the sky that I thocht hell had taen the
place o&#8217; heaven, and that there was waterspouts gathering
therein for the drowning o&#8217; the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no water in hell,&#8221; the precentor said grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Genesis ix.,&#8221; said Spens, &#8220;verses 8 to 17. Ay, but,
Peter, you&#8217;ve startled me, and I&#8217;m thinking we should
be stepping hame. Is that a licht?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be in Nanny Webster&#8217;s,&#8221; Hendry said, after
they had all regarded the light.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard that Nanny needed a candle to licht
her to her bed,&#8221; the precentor muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was awa to meet Sanders the day as he came
out o&#8217; the Tilliedrum gaol,&#8221; Spens remembered, &#8220;and
I daresay the licht means they&#8217;re hame again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s well kent&mdash;&#8221; began Hendry, and would have
recalled his words.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Hendry Munn,&#8221; cried the precentor, &#8220;if you hae
minded onything that may help us, out wi&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just minding,&#8221; the kirk officer answered reluctantly,
&#8220;that Nanny allows it&#8217;s Mr. Dishart that has
been keeping her frae the poorhouse. You canna censure
him for that, Tammas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I no?&#8221; retorted Whamond. &#8220;What business
has he to befriend a woman that belongs to another
denomination? I&#8217;ll see to the bottom o&#8217; that this
nicht. Lads, follow me to Nanny&#8217;s, and dinna be
surprised if we find baith the minister and the Egyptian
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had not advanced many yards when Spens
jumped to the side, crying, &#8220;Be wary, that&#8217;s no the
wind; it&#8217;s a machine!&#8221;</p>
<p>Immediately the doctor&#8217;s dogcart was close to them,
with Rob Dow for its only occupant. He was driving
slowly, or Whamond could not have escaped the horse&#8217;s
hoofs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, Rob Dow?&#8221; said the precentor sourly.
&#8220;I tell you, you&#8217;ll be gaoled for stealing the doctor&#8217;s
machine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hielandman wasna muckle hurt, Rob,&#8221; Hendry
said, more good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ken that,&#8221; replied Rob, scowling at the four of
them. &#8220;What are you doing here on sic a nicht?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see anything strange in the nicht, Rob?&#8221;
Tosh asked apprehensively.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s setting to rain,&#8221; Dow replied. &#8220;I dinna see it,
but I feel it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said Tosh, eagerly, &#8220;but will it be a saft,
cowdie sweet ding-on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the heavens open if they will,&#8221; interposed
Spens recklessly. &#8220;I would swap the drought for rain,
though it comes down in a sheet as in the year twelve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And like a sheet it&#8217;ll come,&#8221; replied Dow, &#8220;and the
deil&#8217;ll blaw it about wi&#8217; his biggest bellowses.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></div>
<p>Tosh shivered, but Whamond shook him roughly,
saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your oaths to yoursel&#8217;, Rob Dow, and tell me,
hae you seen Mr. Dishart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hinna,&#8221; Rob answered curtly, preparing to drive
on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor the lassie they call the Egyptian?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rob leaped from the dogcart, crying, &#8220;What does
that mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands off,&#8221; said the precentor, retreating from him.
&#8220;It means that Mr. Dishart neglected the prayer-meeting
this nicht to philander after that heathen woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re no sure o&#8217;t, Tammas,&#8221; remonstrated the kirk
officer. Dow stood quite still. &#8220;I believe Rob kens
it&#8217;s true,&#8221; Hendry added sadly, &#8220;or he would hae flown
at your throat, Tammas Whamond, for saying these
words.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even this did not rouse Dow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rob doesna worship the minister as he used to do,&#8221;
said Spens.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what for no?&#8221; cried the precentor. &#8220;Rob Dow,
is it because you&#8217;ve found out about this woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a pack o&#8217; liars,&#8221; roared Rob, desperately,
&#8220;and if you say again that ony wandering hussy has
haud o&#8217; the minister, I&#8217;ll let you see whether I can loup
at throats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll swear by the Book,&#8221; asked Whamond, relentlessly,
&#8220;that you&#8217;ve seen neither o&#8217; them this
nicht, nor them thegither at any time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I so swear by the Book,&#8221; answered poor loyal Rob.
&#8220;But what makes you look for Mr. Dishart here?&#8221; he
demanded, with an uneasy look at the light in the mudhouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go hame,&#8221; replied the precentor, &#8220;and deliver up
the machine you stole, and leave this Session to do its
duty. John, we maun fathom the meaning o&#8217; that
licht.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></div>
<p>Dow started, and was probably at that moment within
an ace of felling Whamond.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come wi&#8217; you,&#8221; he said, hunting in his mind
for a better way of helping Gavin.</p>
<p>They were at Nanny&#8217;s garden, but in the darkness
Whamond could not find the gate. Rob climbed the
paling, and was at once lost sight of. Then they saw
his head obscure the window. They did not, however,
hear the groan that startled Babbie.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody there,&#8221; he said, coming back, &#8220;but
Nanny and Sanders. You&#8217;ll mind Sanders was to be
freed the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go in and see Sanders,&#8221; said Hendry, but the
precentor pulled him back, saying, &#8220;You&#8217;ll do nothing
o&#8217; the kind, Hendry Munn; you&#8217;ll come awa wi&#8217; me
now to the manse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mair than me and Peter&#8217;ll do, then,&#8221; said
Spens, who had been consulting with the other farmer.
&#8220;We&#8217;re gaun as straucht hame as the darkness&#8217;ll let
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>With few more words the Session parted, Spens and
Tosh setting off for their farms, and Hendry accompanying
the precentor. No one will ever know where
Dow went. I can fancy him, however, returning to
the wood, and there drawing rein. I can fancy his
mind made up to watch the mudhouse until Gavin and
the gypsy separated, and then pounce upon her. I
daresay his whole plot could be condensed into a sentence,
&#8220;If she&#8217;s got rid o&#8217; this nicht, we may cheat the
Session yet.&#8221; But this is mere surmise. All I know
is that he waited near Nanny&#8217;s house, and by and by
heard another trap coming up Windyghoul. That was
just before the ten o&#8217;clock bell began to ring.</p>

<h2>Chapter Thirty-Two.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />LEADING SWIFTLY TO THE APPALLING MARRIAGE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The little minister bowed his head in assent when
Babbie&#8217;s cry, &#8220;Oh, Gavin, do you?&#8221; leapt in front of
her unselfish wish that he should care for her no more.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that matters very little now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>She was his to do with as he willed; and, perhaps, the
joy of knowing herself loved still, begot a wild hope
that he would refuse to give her up. If so, these words
laid it low, but even the sentence they passed upon her
could not kill the self-respect that would be hers henceforth.
&#8220;That matters very little now,&#8221; the man said,
but to the woman it seemed to matter more than anything
else in the world.</p>
<p>Throughout the remainder of this interview until the
end came, Gavin never faltered. His duty and hers lay
so plainly before him that there could be no straying
from it. Did Babbie think him strangely calm? At
the Glen Quharity gathering I once saw Rob Angus
lift a boulder with such apparent ease that its weight
was discredited, until the cry arose that the effort had
dislocated his arm. Perhaps Gavin&#8217;s quietness deceived
the Egyptian similarly. Had he stamped, she
might have understood better what he suffered, standing
there on the hot embers of his passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must try to make amends now,&#8221; he said
gravely, &#8220;for the wrong we have done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The wrong I have done,&#8221; she said, correcting him.
&#8220;You will make it harder for me if you blame yourself.
How vile I was in those days!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Those days,&#8221; she called them, they seemed so far
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not cry, Babbie,&#8221; Gavin replied, gently. &#8220;He
knew what you were, and why, and He pities you.
&#8216;For His anger endureth but a moment: in His favor
is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh
in the morning.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to you,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Babbie, you will return
to the Spittal now, and tell Lord Rintoul everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wish it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not because I wish it, but because it is right. He
must be told that you do not love him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never pretended to him that I did,&#8221; Babbie said,
looking up. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she added, with emphasis, &#8220;he
knows that. He thinks me incapable of caring for any
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is why he must be told of me,&#8221; Gavin replied.
&#8220;You are no longer the woman you were, Babbie,
and you know it, and I know it, but he does not
know it. He shall know it before he decides whether
he is to marry you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Babbie looked at Gavin, and wondered he did not see
that this decision lay with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the wedding will take
place to-morrow; if it did not, Lord Rintoul would be
the scorn of his friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it does,&#8221; the minister answered, &#8220;he will be the
scorn of himself. Babbie, there is a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no chance,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;I shall be
back at the Spittal without any one&#8217;s knowing of my
absence, and when I begin to tell him of you, he will
tremble, lest it means my refusal to marry him; when
he knows it does not, he will wonder only why I told
him anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will ask you to take time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, he will ask me to put on my wedding-dress.
You must not think anything else possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So be it, then,&#8221; Gavin said firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it will be better so,&#8221; Babbie answered, and
then, seeing him misunderstand her meaning, exclaimed
reproachfully, &#8220;I was not thinking of myself. In the
time to come, whatever be my lot, I shall have the one
consolation, that this is best for you. Think of your
mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will love you,&#8221; Gavin said, &#8220;when I tell her of
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Babbie, wringing her hands; &#8220;she will
almost love me, but for what? For not marrying you.
That is the only reason any one in Thrums will have
for wishing me well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No others,&#8221; Gavin answered, &#8220;will ever know why
I remained unmarried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you never marry?&#8221; Babbie asked, exultingly.
&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she cried, ashamed, &#8220;but you must.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, many a man and many a woman has made that
vow in similar circumstances, and not all have kept it.
But shall we who are old smile cynically at the brief
and burning passion of the young? &#8220;The day,&#8221; you
say, &#8220;will come when&mdash;&#8221; Good sir, hold your peace.
Their agony was great and now is dead, and, maybe,
they have forgotten where it lies buried; but dare you
answer lightly when I ask you which of these things is
saddest?</p>
<p>Babbie believed his &#8220;Never,&#8221; and, doubtless, thought
no worse of him for it; but she saw no way of comforting
him save by disparagement of herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must think of your congregation,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;A minister with a gypsy wife&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would have knocked them about with a flail,&#8221; Gavin
interposed, showing his teeth at the thought of the precentor,
&#8220;until they did her reverence.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></div>
<p>She shook her head, and told him of her meeting
with Micah Dow. It silenced him; not, however, on
account of its pathos, as she thought, but because it interpreted
the riddle of Rob&#8217;s behavior.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; he said ultimately, &#8220;my duty is not
to do what is right in my people&#8217;s eyes, but what seems
right in my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Babbie had not heard him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a face at the window just now,&#8221; she whispered,
drawing closer to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no face there; the very thought of Rob
Dow raises him before you,&#8221; Gavin answered reassuringly,
though Rob was nearer at that moment than
either of them thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go away at once,&#8221; she said, still with her
eyes on the window. &#8220;No, no, you shall not come or
stay with me; it is you who are in danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not fear for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must, if you will not. Before you came in, did I
not hear you speak of a meeting you had to attend
to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My pray&mdash;&#8221; His teeth met on the word; so
abruptly did it conjure up the forgotten prayer-meeting
that before the shock could reach his mind
he stood motionless, listening for the bell. For one
instant all that had taken place since he last heard
it might have happened between two of its tinkles;
Babbie passed from before him like a figure in a
panorama, and he saw, instead, a congregation in their
pews.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you see?&#8221; Babbie cried in alarm, for he
seemed to be gazing at the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only you,&#8221; he replied, himself again; &#8220;I am coming
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must let me go alone,&#8221; she entreated; &#8220;if not
for your own safety&#8221;&mdash;but it was only him she considered&mdash;&#8220;then
for the sake of Lord Rintoul. Were you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
and I to be seen together now, his name and mine
might suffer.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was an argument the minister could not answer
save by putting his hands over his face; his distress
made Babbie strong; she moved to the door, trying to
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go, Babbie!&#8221; Gavin said, controlling his voice,
though it had been a smile more pitiful than her tears.
&#8220;God has you in His keeping; it is not His will to give
me this to bear for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were now in the garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not think of me as unhappy,&#8221; she said; &#8220;it will
be happiness to me to try to be all you would have me
be.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ought to have corrected her. &#8220;All that God
would have me be,&#8221; is what she should have said. But
he only replied, &#8220;You will be a good woman, and none
such can be altogether unhappy; God sees to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He might have kissed her, and perhaps she thought
so.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am&mdash;I am going now, dear,&#8221; she said, and came
back a step because he did not answer; then she went
on, and was out of his sight at three yards&#8217; distance.
Neither of them heard the approaching dogcart.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I am bearing it quite cheerfully,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I shall have everything a woman loves; do not grieve
for me so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin dared not speak nor move. Never had he
found life so hard; but he was fighting with the ignoble
in himself, and winning. She opened the gate, and it
might have been a signal to the dogcart to stop. They
both heard a dog barking, and then the voice of Lord
Rintoul:</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a light in the window. Jump down, McKenzie,
and inquire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin took one step nearer Babbie and stopped.
He did not see how all her courage went from her, so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
that her knees yielded, and she held out her arms to
him, but he heard a great sob and then his name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gavin, I am afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin understood now, and I say he would have been
no man to leave her after that; only a moment was
allowed him, and it was their last chance on earth. He
took it. His arm went round his beloved, and he drew
her away from Nanny&#8217;s.</p>
<p>McKenzie found both house and garden empty.
&#8220;And yet,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I swear some one passed the window
as we sighted it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Waste no more time,&#8221; cried the impatient earl.
&#8220;We must be very near the hill now. You will have
to lead the horse, McKenzie, in this darkness; the dog
may find the way through the broom for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The dog has run on,&#8221; McKenzie replied, now in an
evil temper. &#8220;Who knows, it may be with her now?
So we must feel our way cautiously; there is no call for
capsizing the trap in our haste.&#8221; But there was call
for haste if they were to reach the gypsy encampment
before Gavin and Babbie were made man and wife over
the tongs.</p>
<p>The Spittal dogcart rocked as it dragged its way
through the broom. Rob Dow followed. The ten
o&#8217;clock bell began to ring.</p>

</div>
<p class='center'><i>In the square and wynds&mdash;weavers in groups</i>:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Davit, Mr. Dishart hadna felt the blow the
piper gave him till he ascended the pulpit to conduct
the prayer-meeting for rain, and then he fainted awa.
Tammas Whamond and Peter Tosh carried him to the
Session-house. Ay, an awful scene.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did the minister no come to the meeting? I
wonder how you could expect it, Snecky, and his mother
taen so suddenly ill; he&#8217;s at her bedside, but the doctor
has little hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what has occurred, Tailor: Mr. Dishart
never got the length of the pulpit. He fell in a swound
on the vestry floor. What caused it? Oh, nothing but
the heat. Thrums is so dry that one spark would set it
in a blaze.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I canna get at the richts o&#8217; what keeped him frae
the meeting, Femie, but it had something to do wi&#8217; an
Egyptian on the hill. Very like he had been trying to
stop the gypsy marriage there. I gaed to the manse to
speir at Jean what was wrang, but I&#8217;m thinking I telled
her mair than she could tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, man, Andrew, the wite o&#8217;t lies wi&#8217; Peter
Tosh. He thocht we was to hae sic a terrible rain that
he implored the minister no to pray for it, and so angry
was Mr. Dishart that he ordered the whole Session out
o&#8217; the kirk. I saw them in Couthie&#8217;s close, and michty
dour they looked.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, as sure as death, Tammas Whamond locked
the kirk-door in Mr. Dishart&#8217;s face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a&#8217; shaking! And small wonder, Marget, when
I&#8217;ve heard this minute that Mr. Dishart&#8217;s been struck
by lichtning while looking for Rob Dow. He&#8217;s no
killed, but, woe&#8217;s me! they say he&#8217;ll never preach
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing o&#8217; the kind. It was Rob that the lichtning
struck dead in the doctor&#8217;s machine. The horse wasna
touched; it came tearing down the Roods wi&#8217; the corpse
sitting in the machine like a living man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you listening to, woman? Is it to a dog
barking? I&#8217;ve heard it this while, but it&#8217;s far awa.&#8221;</p>
<p class='center'><i>In the manse kitchen</i>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean, did you not hear me ring? I want you to&mdash;Why
are you staring out at the window, Jean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I was just hearkening to the ten o&#8217;clock bell,
ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw you doing nothing before! Put the
heater in the fire, Jean. I want to iron the minister&#8217;s
neckcloths. The prayer-meeting is long in coming out,
is it not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The&mdash;the drouth, ma&#8217;am, has been so cruel hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, to my shame, I am so comfortable that I
almost forgot how others are suffering. But my son
never forgets, Jean. You are not crying, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring the iron to the parlor, then. And if the
minis&mdash;Why did you start, Jean? I only heard a dog
barking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thocht, ma&#8217;am&mdash;at first I thocht it was Mr. Dishart
opening the door. Ay, it&#8217;s just a dog; some gypsy dog
on the hill, I&#8217;m thinking, for sound would carry far the
nicht.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even you, Jean, are nervous at nights, I see, if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
there is no man in the house. We shall hear no more
distant dogs barking, I warrant, when the minister
comes home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When he comes home, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p class='center'><i>On the middle of a hill&mdash;a man and a woman</i>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Courage, beloved; we are nearly there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Gavin, I cannot see the encampment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The night is too dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the gypsy fires?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are in the Toad&#8217;s-hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to that dog barking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are several dogs at the encampment, Babbie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one behind us. See, there it is!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have driven it away, dear. You are trembling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are doing frightens me, Gavin. It is at
your heels again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to know you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Gavin, it is Lord Rintoul&#8217;s collie Snap. It will
bite you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I have driven it back again. Probably the earl
is following us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gavin, I cannot go on with this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quicker, Babbie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave me, dear, and save yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lean on me, Babbie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Gavin, is there no way but this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No sure way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though we are married to-night&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall be <ins title='Was maried'>married</ins> in five minutes, and then,
whatever befall, he cannot have you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But after?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will take you straight to the manse, to my
mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were it not for that dog, I should think we were
alone on the hill.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But we are not. See, there are the gypsy fires.&#8221;</p>
<p class='center'><i>On the west side of the hill&mdash;two figures</i>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tammas, Tammas Whamond, I&#8217;ve lost you. Should
we gang to the manse down the fields?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wheesht, Hendry!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you listening for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard a dog barking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a gypsy dog, Tammas, barking at the coming
storm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The gypsy dogs are all tied up, and this one&#8217;s atween
us and the Toad&#8217;s-hole. What was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was nothing but the rubbing of the branches in
the cemetery on ane another. It&#8217;s said, trees mak&#8217;
that fearsome sound when they&#8217;re terrified.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a dog barking at somebody that&#8217;s stoning it.
I ken that sound, Hendry Munn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I die the death, Tammas Whamond, if a great
drap o&#8217; rain didna strike me the now, and I swear it
was warm. I&#8217;m for running hame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m for seeing who drove awa that dog. Come back
wi&#8217; me, Hendry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I winna. There&#8217;s no a soul on the hill but you and
me and thae daffing and drinking gypsies. How do
you no answer me, Tammas? Hie, Tammas Whamond,
whaur are you? He&#8217;s gone! Ay, then I&#8217;ll mak&#8217; tracks
hame.&#8221;</p>
<p class='center'><i>In the broom&mdash;a dogcart</i>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see nothing yet, McKenzie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scarce the broom at my knees, Rintoul. There is
not a light on the hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;McKenzie, can that schoolmaster have deceived us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is probable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Urge on the horse, however. There is a road
through the broom, I know. Have we stuck again?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Rintoul, she is not here. I promised to help you to
bring her back to the Spittal before this escapade became
known, but we have failed to find her. If she is
to be saved, it must be by herself. I daresay she has
returned already. Let me turn the horse&#8217;s head.
There is a storm brewing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will search this gypsy encampment first, if it is on
the hill. Hark! that was a dog&#8217;s bark. Yes, it is
Snap; but he would not bark at nothing. Why do you
look behind you so often, McKenzie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For some time, Rintoul, it has seemed to me that
we are being followed. Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear nothing. At last, McKenzie, at last, we are
out of the broom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And as I live, Rintoul, I see the gypsy lights!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It might have been a lantern that was flashed across
the hill. Then all that part of the world went suddenly
on fire. Everything was horribly distinct in that white
light. The firs of Caddam were so near that it seemed
to have arrested them in a silent march upon the hill.
The grass would not hide a pebble. The ground was
scored with shadows of men and things. Twice the
light flickered and recovered itself. A red serpent shot
across it, and then again black night fell.</p>
<p>The hill had been illumined thus for nearly half a
minute. During that time not even a dog stirred.
The shadows of human beings lay on the ground as
motionless as logs. What had been revealed seemed
less a gypsy marriage than a picture. Or was it that
during the ceremony every person on the hill had been
turned into stone? The gypsy king, with his arm upraised,
had not had time to let it fall. The men and
women behind him had their mouths open, as if struck
when on the point of calling out. Lord Rintoul had
risen in the dogcart and was leaning forward. One of
McKenzie&#8217;s feet was on the shaft. The man crouching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
in the dogcart&#8217;s wake had flung up his hands to protect
his face. The precentor, his neck outstretched, had a
hand on each knee. All eyes were fixed, as in the death
glare, on Gavin and Babbie, who stood before the king,
their hands clasped over the tongs. Fear was petrified
on the woman&#8217;s face, determination on the man&#8217;s.</p>
<p>They were all released by the crack of the thunder,
but for another moment none could have swaggered.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was Lord Rintoul in the dogcart,&#8221; Babbie
whispered, drawing in her breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; Gavin answered resolutely, &#8220;and now is
the time for me to have my first and last talk with him.
Remain here, Babbie. Do not move till I come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Gavin, he has seen. I fear him still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He cannot touch you now, Babbie. You are my
wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the vivid light Gavin had thought the dogcart
much nearer than it was. He called Lord Rintoul&#8217;s
name, but got no answer. There were shouts behind,
gypsies running from the coming rain, dogs whining,
but silence in front. The minister moved on some
paces. Away to the left he heard voices&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was the man, McKenzie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My lord, I have lost sight of you. This is not the
way to the camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, McKenzie, that you did not see what I saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rintoul, I beseech you to turn back. We are too
late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin broke through the darkness between them and
him, but they were gone. He called to them, and
stopped to listen to their feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, Gavin?&#8221; Babbie asked just then.</p>
<p>For reply, the man who had crept up to her clapped
his hand upon her mouth. Only the beginning of a
scream escaped from her. A strong arm drove her
quickly southward.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></div>
<p>Gavin heard her cry, and ran back to the encampment.
Babbie was gone. None of the gypsies had seen
her since the darkness came back. He rushed hither
and thither with a torch that only showed his distracted
face to others. He flung up his arms in appeal for another
moment of light; then he heard Babbie scream
again, and this time it was from a distance. He dashed
after her; he heard a trap speeding down the green
sward through the broom.</p>
<p>Lord Rintoul had kidnapped Babbie. Gavin had no
other thought as he ran after the dogcart from which
the cry had come. The earl&#8217;s dog followed him, snapping
at his heels. The rain began.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_THIRTYFOUR_THE_GREAT_RAIN' id='CHAPTER_THIRTYFOUR_THE_GREAT_RAIN'></a>
<h2>Chapter Thirty-Four.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />THE GREAT RAIN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Gavin passed on through Windyghoul, thinking in
his frenzy that he still heard the trap. In a rain that
came down like iron rods every other sound was beaten
dead. He slipped, and before he could regain his feet
the dog bit him. To protect himself from dikes and
trees and other horrors of the darkness he held his arm
before him, but soon it was driven to his side. Wet
whips cut his brow so that he had to protect it with his
hands, until it had to bear the lash again, for they
would not. Now he had forced up his knees, and would
have succumbed but for a dread of being pinned to the
earth. This fight between the man and the rain went
on all night, and long before it ended the man was
past the power of thinking.</p>
<p>In the ringing of the ten o&#8217;clock bell Gavin had lived
the seventh part of a man&#8217;s natural life. Only action
was required of him. That accomplished, his mind
had begun to work again, when suddenly the loss of
Babbie stopped it, as we may put out a fire with a great
coal. The last thing he had reflected about was a dogcart
in motion, and, consequently, this idea clung to
him. His church, his mother, were lost knowledge of,
but still he seemed to hear the trap in front.</p>
<p>The rain increased in violence, appalling even those
who heard it from under cover. However rain may
storm, though it be an army of archers battering roofs
and windows, it is only terrifying when the noise swells
every instant. In those hours of darkness it again and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
again grew in force and doubled its fury, and was louder,
louder, and louder, until its next attack was to be more
than men and women could listen to. They held each
other&#8217;s hands and stood waiting. Then abruptly it
abated, and people could speak. I believe a rain that
became heavier every second for ten minutes would drive
many listeners mad. Gavin was in it on a night that
tried us repeatedly for quite half that time.</p>
<p>By and by even the vision of Babbie in the dogcart
was blotted out. If nothing had taken its place, he
would not have gone on probably; and had he turned
back objectless, his strength would have succumbed to
the rain. Now he saw Babbie and Rintoul being married
by a minister who was himself, and there was a
fair company looking on, and always when he was on
the point of shouting to himself, whom he could see
clearly, that this woman was already married, the rain
obscured his words and the light went out. Presently
the ceremony began again, always to stop at the same
point. He saw it in the lightning-flash that had startled
the hill. It gave him courage to fight his way onward,
because he thought he must be heard if he could draw
nearer to the company.</p>
<p>A regiment of cavalry began to trouble him. He
heard it advancing from the Spittal, but was not dismayed,
for it was, as yet, far distant. The horsemen
came thundering on, filling the whole glen of Quharity.
Now he knew that they had been sent out to ride him
down. He paused in dread, until they had swept past
him. They came back to look for him, riding more
furiously than ever, and always missed him, yet his
fears of the next time were not lessened. They were
only the rain.</p>
<p>All through the night the dog followed him. He
would forget it for a time, and then it would be so close
that he could see it dimly. He never heard it bark,
but it snapped at him, and a grin had become the expression
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
of its face. He stoned it, he even flung himself
at it, he addressed it in caressing tones, and always with
the result that it disappeared, to come back presently.</p>
<p>He found himself walking in a lake, and now even
the instinct of self-preservation must have been flickering,
for he waded on, rejoicing merely in getting rid of
the dog. Something in the water rose and struck him.
Instead of stupefying him, the blow brought him to his
senses, and he struggled for his life. The ground
slipped beneath his feet many times, but at last he was
out of the water. That he was out in a flood he did not
realize; yet he now acted like one in full possession of
his faculties. When his feet sank in water, he drew
back; and many times he sought shelter behind banks
and rocks, first testing their firmness with his hands.
Once a torrent of stones, earth, and heather carried him
down a hillside until he struck against a tree. He
twined his arms round it, and had just done so when it
fell with him. After that, when he touched trees
growing in water, he fled from them, thus probably
saving himself from death.</p>
<p>What he heard now might have been the roll and
crack of the thunder. It sounded in his ear like nothing
else. But it was really something that swept down
the hill in roaring spouts of water, and it passed on
both sides of him so that at one moment, had he
paused, it would have crashed into him, and at another
he was only saved by stopping. He felt that the struggle
in the dark was to go on till the crack of doom.</p>
<p>Then he cast himself upon the ground. It moved
beneath him like some great animal, and he rose and
stole away from it. Several times did this happen.
The stones against which his feet struck seemed to acquire
life from his touch. So strong had he become, or
so weak all other things, that whatever clump he laid
hands on by which to pull himself out of the water was
at once rooted up.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></div>
<p>The daylight would not come. He longed passionately
for it. He tried to remember what it was like,
and could not; he had been blind so long. It was away
in front somewhere, and he was struggling to overtake
it. He expected to see it from a dark place, when he
would rush forward to bathe his arms in it, and then the
elements that were searching the world for him would
see him and he would perish. But death did not seem
too great a penalty to pay for light.</p>
<p>And at last day did come back, gray and drear. He
saw suddenly once more. I think he must have been
wandering the glen with his eyes shut, as one does shut
them involuntarily against the hidden dangers of black
night. How different was daylight from what he had
expected! He looked, and then shut his dazed eyes
again, for the darkness was less horrible than the day.
Had he indeed seen, or only dreamed that he saw?
Once more he looked to see what the world was like;
and the sight that met his eyes was so mournful that
he who had fought through the long night now sank
hopeless and helpless among the heather. The dog
was not far away, and it, too, lost heart. Gavin held
out his hand, and Snap crept timidly toward him. He
unloosened his coat, and the dog nestled against him,
cowed and shivering, hiding its head from the day.
Thus they lay, and the rain beat upon them.</p>

<h2>Chapter Thirty-Five.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />THE GLEN AT BREAK OF DAY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>My first intimation that the burns were in flood came
from Waster Lunny, close on the strike of ten o&#8217;clock.
This was some minutes before they had any rain in
Thrums. I was in the school-house, now piecing together
the puzzle Lord Rintoul had left with me, and
anon starting upright as McKenzie&#8217;s hand seemed to
tighten on my arm. Waster Lunny had been whistling
to me (with his fingers in his mouth) for some time before
I heard him and hurried out. I was surprised and
pleased, knowing no better, to be met on the threshold
by a whisk of rain.</p>
<p>The night was not then so dark but that when I
reached the Quharity I could see the farmer take shape
on the other side of it. He wanted me to exult with
him, I thought, in the end of the drought, and I shouted
that I would fling him the stilts.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s yoursel&#8217; that wants them,&#8221; he answered excitedly,
&#8220;if you&#8217;re fleid to be left alone in the school-house
the nicht. Do you hear me, dominie? There has been
frichtsome rain among the hills, and the Bog burn is
coming down like a sea. It has carried awa the miller&#8217;s
brig, and the steading o&#8217; Muckle Pirley is standing
three feet in water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re dreaming, man,&#8221; I roared back, but beside
his news he held my doubts of no account.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Retery&#8217;s in flood,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;and running
wild through Hazel Wood; T&#8217;nowdunnie&#8217;s tattie field&#8217;s
out o&#8217; sicht, and at the Kirkton they&#8217;re fleid they&#8217;ve
lost twa kye.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There has been no rain here,&#8221; I stammered, incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s coming now,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;And listen: the
story&#8217;s out that the Backbone has fallen into the loch.
You had better cross, dominie, and thole out the nicht
wi&#8217; us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Backbone was a piece of mountain-side overhanging
a loch among the hills, and legend said that it
would one day fall forward and squirt all the water into
the glen. Something of the kind had happened, but I
did not believe it then; with little wit I pointed to the
shallow Quharity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may come down at any minute,&#8221; the farmer answered,
&#8220;and syne, mind you, you&#8217;ll be five miles frae
Waster Lunny, for there&#8217;ll be no crossing but by the
Brig o&#8217; March. If you winna come, I maun awa back.
I mauna bide langer on the wrang side o&#8217; the Moss
ditch, though it has been as dry this month back as a
rabbit&#8217;s roady. But if you&mdash;&#8221; His voice changed.
&#8220;God&#8217;s sake, man,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;you&#8217;re ower late. Look
at that! Dinna look&mdash;run, run!&#8221;</p>
<p>If I had not run before he bade me, I might never
have run again on earth. I had seen a great shadowy
yellow river come riding down the Quharity. I sprang
from it for my life; and when next I looked behind, it
was upon a turbulent loch, the further bank lost in
darkness. I was about to shout to Waster Lunny, when
a monster rose in the torrent between me and the spot
where he had stood. It frightened me to silence until
it fell, when I knew it was but a tree that had been
flung on end by the flood. For a time there was no
answer to my cries, and I thought the farmer had been
swept away. Then I heard his whistle, and back I ran
recklessly through the thickening darkness to the
school-house. When I saw the tree rise, I had been on
ground hardly wet as yet with the rain; but by the time
Waster Lunny sent that reassuring whistle to me I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
ankle-deep in water, and the rain was coming down like
hail. I saw no lightning.</p>
<p>For the rest of the night I was only out once, when I
succeeded in reaching the hen-house and brought all
my fowls safely to the kitchen, except a hen which
would not rise off her young. Between us we had the
kitchen floor, a pool of water; and the rain had put out
my fires already, as effectually as if it had been an
overturned broth-pot. That I never took off my clothes
that night I need not say, though of what was happening
in the glen I could only guess. A flutter against
my window now and again, when the rain had abated,
told me of another bird that had flown there to die; and
with Waster Lunny, I kept up communication by waving
a light, to which he replied in a similar manner.
Before morning, however, he ceased to answer my signals,
and I feared some catastrophe had occurred at the
farm. As it turned out, the family was fighting with
the flood for the year&#8217;s shearing of wool, half of which
eventually went down the waters, with the wool-shed
on top of it.</p>
<p>The school-house stands too high to fear any flood,
but there were moments when I thought the rain would
master it. Not only the windows and the roof were
rattling then, but all the walls, and I was like one in a
great drum. When the rain was doing its utmost, I
heard no other sound; but when the lull came, there
was the wash of a heavy river, or a crack as of artillery
that told of landslips, or the plaintive cry of the peesweep
as it rose in the air, trying to entice the waters
away from its nest.</p>
<p>It was a dreary scene that met my gaze at break of
day. Already the Quharity had risen six feet, and in
many parts of the glen it was two hundred yards wide.
Waster Lunny&#8217;s cornfield looked like a bog grown over
with rushes, and what had been his turnips had become
a lake with small islands in it. No dike stood whole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
except one that the farmer, unaided, had built in a
straight line from the road to the top of Mount Bare,
and my own, the further end of which dipped in water.
Of the plot of firs planted fifty years earlier to help on
Waster Lunny&#8217;s crops, only a triangle had withstood
the night.</p>
<p>Even with the aid of my field-glass I could not estimate
the damage on more distant farms, for the rain,
though now thin and soft, as it continued for six days,
was still heavy and of a brown color. After breakfast&mdash;which
was interrupted by my bantam cock&#8217;s twice
spilling my milk&mdash;I saw Waster Lunny and his son,
Matthew, running towards the shepherd&#8217;s house with
ropes in their hands. The house, I thought, must be
in the midst beyond; and then I sickened, knowing all
at once that it should be on this side of the mist. When
I had nerve to look again, I saw that though the roof
had fallen in, the shepherd was astride one of the walls,
from which he was dragged presently through the water
by the help of the ropes. I remember noticing that he
returned to his house with the rope still about him, and
concluded that he had gone back to save some of his
furniture. I was wrong, however. There was too
much to be done at the farm to allow this, but Waster
Lunny had consented to Duncan&#8217;s forcing his way back
to the shieling to stop the clock. To both men it
seemed horrible to let a clock go on ticking in a deserted
house.</p>
<p>Having seen this rescue accomplished, I was letting
my glass roam in the opposite direction, when one of
its shakes brought into view something on my own side
of the river. I looked at it long, and saw it move
slightly. Was it a human being? No, it was a dog.
No, it was a dog and something else. I hurried out to
see more clearly, and after a first glance the glass shook
so in my hands that I had to rest it on the dike. For
a full minute, I daresay, did I look through the glass
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
without blinking, and then I needed to look no more.
That black patch was, indeed, Gavin.</p>
<p>He lay quite near the school-house, but I had to make
a circuit of half a mile to reach him. It was pitiful to
see the dog doing its best to come to me, and falling
every few steps. The poor brute was discolored
almost beyond recognition; and when at last it reached
me, it lay down at my feet and licked them. I stepped
over it and ran on recklessly to Gavin. At first I
thought he was dead. If tears rolled down my cheeks,
they were not for him.</p>
<p>I was no strong man even in those days, but I carried
him to the school-house, the dog crawling after us.
Gavin I put upon my bed, and I lay down beside him,
holding him close to me, that some of the heat of my
body might be taken in by his. When he was able to
look at me, however, it was not with understanding,
and in vain did my anxiety press him with questions.
Only now and again would some word in my speech
strike upon his brain and produce at least an echo. To
&#8220;Did you meet Lord Rintoul&#8217;s dogcart?&#8221; he sat up,
saying quickly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, the dogcart!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Egyptian&#8221; was not that forenoon among the words
he knew, and I did not think of mentioning &#8220;hill.&#8221; At
&#8220;rain&#8221; he shivered; but &#8220;Spittal&#8221; was what told me
most.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has taken her back,&#8221; he replied at once, from
which I learned that Gavin now knew as much of Babbie
as I did.</p>
<p>I made him as comfortable as possible, and despairing
of learning anything from him in his present state,
I let him sleep. Then I went out into the rain, very
anxious, and dreading what he might have to tell me
when he woke. I waded and jumped my way as near
to the farm as I dared go, and Waster Lunny, seeing
me, came to the water&#8217;s edge. At this part the breadth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
of the flood was not forty yards, yet for a time our
voices could no more cross its roar than one may send a
snowball through a stone wall. I know not whether
the river then quieted for a space, or if it was only that
the ears grow used to dins as the eyes distinguish the
objects in a room that is at first black to them; but after
a little we were able to shout our remarks across, much
as boys fling pebbles, many to fall into the water, but
one occasionally to reach the other side. Waster Lunny
would have talked of the flood, but I had not come here
for that.</p>
<p>&#8220;How were you home so early from the prayer-meeting
last night?&#8221; I bawled.</p>
<p>&#8220;No meeting ... I came straucht hame ... but
terrible stories ... Mr. Dishart,&#8221; was all I caught
after Waster Lunny had flung his words across a dozen
times.</p>
<p>I could not decide whether it would be wise to tell
him that Gavin was in the school-house, and while I
hesitated he continued to shout:</p>
<p>&#8220;Some woman ... the Session ... Lang Tammas ...
God forbid ... maun back to the farm ...
byre running like a mill-dam.&#8221;</p>
<p>He signed to me that he must be off, but my signals
delayed him, and after much trouble he got my question,
&#8220;Any news about Lord Rintoul?&#8221; My curiosity
about the earl must have surprised him, but he
answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Marriage is to be the day ... cannon.&#8221;</p>
<p>I signed that I did not grasp his meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;A cannon is to be fired as soon as they&#8217;re man and
wife,&#8221; he bellowed. &#8220;We&#8217;ll hear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that we parted. On my way home, I remember,
I stepped on a brood of drowned partridge. I was
only out half an hour, but I had to wring my clothes as
if they were fresh from the tub.</p>
<p>The day wore on, and I did not disturb the sleeper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
A dozen times, I suppose, I had to relight my fire of
wet peats and roots; but I had plenty of time to stare
out at the window, plenty of time to think. Probably
Gavin&#8217;s life depended on his sleeping, but that was not
what kept my hands off him. Knowing so little of
what had happened in Thrums since I left it, I was
forced to guess, and my conclusion was that the earl had
gone off with his own, and that Gavin in a frenzy had
followed them. My wisest course, I thought, was to
let him sleep until I heard the cannon, when his struggle
for a wife must end. Fifty times at least did I
stand regarding him as he slept; and if I did not pity
his plight sufficiently, you know the reason. What
were Margaret&#8217;s sufferings at this moment? Was she
wringing her hands for her son lost in the flood, her
son in disgrace with the congregation? By one o&#8217;clock
no cannon had sounded, and my suspense had become
intolerable. I shook Gavin awake, and even as I shook
him demanded a knowledge of all that had happened
since we parted at Nanny&#8217;s gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long ago is that?&#8221; he asked, with bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was last night,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;This morning I
found you senseless on the hillside, and brought you
here, to the Glen Quharity school-house. That dog
was with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at the dog, but I kept my eyes on him,
and I saw intelligence creep back, like a blush, into his
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I remember,&#8221; he said, shuddering. &#8220;You
have proved yourself my friend, sir, twice in the four
and twenty hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only once, I fear,&#8221; I replied gloomily. &#8220;I was no
friend when I sent you to the earl&#8217;s bride last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know who she is?&#8221; he cried, clutching me, and
finding it agony to move his limbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know now,&#8221; I said, and had to tell him how I knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
before he would answer another question. Then I became
listener, and you who read know to what alarming
story.</p>
<p>&#8220;And all that time,&#8221; I cried reproachfully, when he
had done, &#8220;you gave your mother not a thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thought,&#8221; he answered; and I saw that he
pronounced a harsher sentence on himself than could
have come from me. &#8220;All that time!&#8221; he repeated,
after a moment. &#8220;It was only a few minutes, while
the ten o&#8217;clock bell was ringing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a few minutes,&#8221; I said, &#8220;but they changed the
channel of the Quharity, and perhaps they have done
not less to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be,&#8221; he answered gravely, &#8220;but it is of
the present I must think just now. Mr. Ogilvy, what
assurance have I, while lying here helpless, that the
marriage at the Spittal is not going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None, I hope,&#8221; I said to myself, and listened longingly
for the cannon. But to him I only pointed out
that no woman need go through a form of marriage
against her will.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rintoul carried her off with no possible purport,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;but to set my marriage at defiance, and she has
had a conviction always that to marry me would be to
ruin me. It was only in the shiver Lord Rintoul&#8217;s
voice in the darkness sent through her that she yielded
to my wishes. If she thought that marriage last night
could be annulled by another to-day, she would consent
to the second, I believe, to save me from the effects of
the first. You are incredulous, sir; but you do not
know of what sacrifices love is capable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something of that I knew, but I did not tell him. I
had seen from his manner rather than his words that
he doubted the validity of the gypsy marriage, which
the king had only consented to celebrate because Babbie
was herself an Egyptian. The ceremony had been
interrupted in the middle.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It was no marriage,&#8221; I said, with a confidence I was
far from feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the sight of God,&#8221; he replied excitedly, &#8220;we took
each other for man and wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had to hold him down in bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are too weak to stand, man,&#8221; I said, &#8220;and yet
you think you could start off this minute for the
Spittal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;She is my wife. That impious
marriage may have taken place already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that it had!&#8221; was my prayer. &#8220;It has not,&#8221; I
said to him. &#8220;A cannon is to be fired immediately
after the ceremony, and all the glen will hear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I spoke on the impulse, thinking to allay his desire
to be off; but he said, &#8220;Then I may yet be in time.&#8221;
Somewhat cruelly I let him rise, that he might realize
his weakness. Every bone in him cried out at his first
step, and he sank into a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will go to the Spittal for me?&#8221; he implored.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;You are asking me to
fling away my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>To prove my words I opened the door, and he saw
what the flood was doing. Nevertheless, he rose and
tottered several times across the room, trying to revive
his strength. Though every bit of him was aching, I
saw that he would make the attempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Lord Rintoul can maintain
with some reason that it was you rather than he who
abducted Babbie. Nevertheless, there will not, I am
convinced, be any marriage at the Spittal to-day.
When he carried her off from the Toad&#8217;s-hole, he acted
under impulses not dissimilar to those that took you to
it. Then, I doubt not, he thought possession was all
the law, but that scene on the hill has staggered him
by this morning. Even though she thinks to save you
by marrying him, he will defer his wedding until he
learns the import of yours.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></div>
<p>I did not believe in my own reasoning, but I would
have said anything to detain him until that cannon was
fired. He seemed to read my purpose, for he pushed
my arguments from him with his hands, and continued
to walk painfully to and fro.</p>
<p>&#8220;To defer the wedding,&#8221; he said, &#8220;would be to tell
all his friends of her gypsy origin, and of me. He will
risk much to avoid that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In any case,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;you must now give some
thought to those you have forgotten, your mother and
your church.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That must come afterwards,&#8221; he said firmly. &#8220;My
first duty is to my wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door swung to sharply just then, and he started.
He thought it was the cannon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to God it had been!&#8221; I cried, interpreting
his thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you wish me ill?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dishart,&#8221; I said solemnly, rising and facing
him, and disregarding his question, &#8220;if that woman is
to be your wife, it will be at a cost you cannot estimate
till you return to Thrums. Do you think that if your
congregation knew of this gypsy marriage they would
have you for their minister for another day? Do you
enjoy the prospect of taking one who might be an earl&#8217;s
wife into poverty&mdash;ay, and disgraceful poverty? Do
you know your mother so little as to think she could
survive your shame? Let me warn you, sir, of what I
see. I see another minister in the Auld Licht kirk,
I see you and your wife stoned through our wynds,
stoned from Thrums, as malefactors have been chased
out of it ere now; and as certainly as I see these things
I see a hearse standing at the manse door, and stern
men denying a son&#8217;s right to help to carry his mother&#8217;s
coffin to it. Go your way, sir; but first count the cost.&#8221;</p>
<p>His face quivered before these blows, but all he said
was, &#8220;I must dree my dreed.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></div>
<p>&#8220;God is merciful,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;and these things need
not be. He is more merciful to you, sir, than to some,
for the storm that He sent to save you is ruining them.
And yet the farmers are to-day thanking Him for every
pound of wool, every blade of corn He has left them,
while you turn from Him because He would save you,
not in your way, but in His. It was His hand that
stayed your marriage. He meant Babbie for the earl;
and if it is on her part a loveless match, she only suffers
for her own sins. Of that scene on the hill no one in
Thrums, or in the glen, need ever know. Rintoul will
see to it that the gypsies vanish from these parts forever,
and you may be sure the Spittal will soon be shut
up. He and McKenzie have as much reason as yourself
to be silent. You, sir, must go back to your congregation,
who have heard as yet only vague rumors
that your presence will dispel. Even your mother will
remain ignorant of what has happened. Your absence
from the prayer-meeting you can leave to me to explain.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was so silent that I thought him mine, but his
first words undeceived me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I had nowhere so keen a friend,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;but, Mr. Ogilvy, it is devil&#8217;s work you are pleading.
Am I to return to my people to act a living lie before
them to the end of my days? Do you really think that
God devastated a glen to give me a chance of becoming
a villain? No, sir, I am in His hands, and I will do
what I think right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be dishonored,&#8221; I said, &#8220;in the sight of
God and man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in God&#8217;s sight,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;It was a sinless
marriage, Mr. Ogilvy, and I do not regret it. God
ordained that she and I should love each other, and He
put it into my power to save her from that man. I
took her as my wife before Him, and in His eyes I am
her husband. Knowing that, sir, how could I return
to Thrums without her?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></div>
<p>I had no answer ready for him. I knew that in my
grief for Margaret I had been advocating an unworthy
course, but I would not say so. I went gloomily to the
door, and there, presently, his hand fell on my shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your advice came too late, at any rate,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You forget that the precentor was on the hill and saw
everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was he who had forgotten to tell me this, and to
me it was the most direful news of all.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;He will have gone to your
mother and told her.&#8221; And straightway I began to
lace my boots.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; he asked, staring at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;To Thrums,&#8221; I answered harshly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said that to venture out into the glen was to
court death,&#8221; he reminded me.</p>
<p>&#8220;What of that?&#8221; I said, and hastily put on my coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Ogilvy,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I will not allow you to do
this for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For you?&#8221; I said bitterly. &#8220;It is not for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would have gone at once, but he got in front of me,
asking, &#8220;Did you ever know my mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Long ago,&#8221; I answered shortly, and he said no
more, thinking, I suppose, that he knew all. He
limped to the door with me, and I had only advanced a
few steps when I understood better than before what
were the dangers I was to venture into. Since I spoke
to Waster Lunny the river had risen several feet, and
even the hillocks in his turnip-field were now submerged.
The mist was creeping down the hills. But
what warned me most sharply that the flood was not
satisfied yet was the top of the school-house dike; it
was lined with field-mice. I turned back, and Gavin,
mistaking my meaning, said I did wisely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not changed my mind,&#8221; I told him, and then
had some difficulty in continuing. &#8220;I expect,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;to reach Thrums safely, even though I should be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
caught in the mist, but I shall have to go round by the
Kelpie brig in order to get across the river, and it is
possible that&mdash;that something may befall me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have all my life been something of a coward, and
my voice shook when I said this, so that Gavin again
entreated me to remain at the school-house, saying that
if I did not he would accompany me.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so increase my danger tenfold?&#8221; I pointed out.
&#8220;No, no, Mr. Dishart, I go alone; and if I can do nothing
with the congregation, I can at least send your
mother word that you still live. But if anything should
happen to me, I want you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But I could not say what I had come back to say. I
had meant to ask him, in the event of my death, to
take a hundred pounds which were the savings of my
life; but now I saw that this might lead to Margaret&#8217;s
hearing of me, and so I stayed my words. It was bitter
to me this, and yet, after all, a little thing when put
beside the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, Mr. Dishart,&#8221; I said abruptly. I then
looked at my desk, which contained some trifles that
were once Margaret&#8217;s. &#8220;Should anything happen to
me,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I want that old desk to be destroyed unopened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Ogilvy,&#8221; he answered gently, &#8220;you are venturing
this because you loved my mother. If anything
does befall you, be assured that I will tell her what
you attempted for her sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>I believe he thought it was to make some such request
that I had turned back.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must tell her nothing about me,&#8221; I exclaimed,
in consternation. &#8220;Swear that my name will never
cross your lips before her. No, that is not enough.
You must forget me utterly, whether I live or die, lest
some time you should think of me and she should read
your thoughts. Swear, man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must this be?&#8221; he said, gazing at me.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered more calmly, &#8220;it must be. For
nearly a score of years I have been blotted out of your
mother&#8217;s life, and since she came to Thrums my one care
has been to keep my existence from her. I have
changed my burying-ground even from Thrums to the
glen, lest I should die before her, and she, seeing the
hearse go by the Tenements, might ask, &#8216;Whose funeral
is this?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>In my anxiety to warn him, I had said too much.
His face grew haggard, and there was fear to speak on
it; and I saw, I knew, that some damnable suspicion of
Margaret&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was my wife!&#8221; I cried sharply. &#8220;We were
married by the minister of Harvie. You are my son.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Chapter Thirty-Six.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />STORY OF THE DOMINIE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>When I spoke next, I was back in the school-house,
sitting there with my bonnet on my head, Gavin looking
at me. We had forgotten the cannon at last.</p>
<p>In that chair I had anticipated this scene more than
once of late. I had seen that a time might come when
Gavin would have to be told all, and I had even said
the words aloud, as if he were indeed opposite me. So
now I was only repeating the tale, and I could tell it
without emotion, because it was nigh nineteen years
old; and I did not look at Gavin, for I knew that his
manner of taking it could bring no change to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you never ask your mother,&#8221; I said, addressing
the fire rather than him, &#8220;why you were called Gavin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;it was because she thought
Gavin a prettier name than Adam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I said slowly, &#8220;it was because Gavin is my
name. You were called after your father. Do you not
remember my taking you one day to the shore at Harvie
to see the fishermen carried to their boats upon their
wives&#8217; backs, that they might start dry on their
journey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he had to reply. &#8220;I remember the women
carrying the men through the water to the boats, but I
thought it was my father who&mdash;I mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know whom you mean,&#8221; I said. &#8220;That was our
last day together, but you were not three years old.
Yet you remembered me when you came to Thrums.
You shake your head, but it is true. Between the diets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
of worship that first Sabbath I was introduced to you,
and you must have had some shadowy recollection of
my face, for you asked, &#8216;Surely I saw you in church in
the forenoon, Mr. Ogilvy?&#8217; I said &#8216;Yes,&#8217; but I had
not been in the church in the forenoon. You have forgotten
even that, and yet I treasured it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could hear that he was growing impatient, though
so far he had been more indulgent than I had any right
to expect.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can all be put into a sentence,&#8221; I said calmly.
&#8220;Margaret married Adam Dishart, and afterwards, believing
herself a widow, she married me. You were
born, and then Adam Dishart came back.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is my whole story, and here was I telling it to
my son, and not a tear between us. It ended abruptly,
and I fell to mending the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I knew your mother first,&#8221; I went on, after
Gavin had said some boyish things that were of no avail
to me, &#8220;I did not think to end my days as a dominie.
I was a student at Aberdeen, with the ministry in my
eye, and sometimes on Saturdays I walked forty miles
to Harvie to go to church with her. She had another
lover, Adam Dishart, a sailor turned fisherman; and
while I lingered at corners, wondering if I could dare
to meet her and her mother on their way to church, he
would walk past with them. He was accompanied
always by a lanky black dog, which he had brought
from a foreign country. He never signed for any ship
without first getting permission to take it with him, and
in Harvie they said it did not know the language of the
native dogs. I have never known a man and dog so
attached to each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember that black dog,&#8221; Gavin said. &#8220;I have
spoken of it to my mother, and she shuddered, as if it
had once bitten her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;While Adam strutted by with them,&#8221; I continued,
&#8220;I would hang back, raging at his assurance or my own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
timidity; but I lost my next chance in the same way.
In Margaret&#8217;s presence something came over me, a kind
of dryness in the throat, that made me dumb. I have
known divinity students stricken in the same way, just
as they were giving out their first text. It is no aid in
getting a kirk or wooing a woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;If any one in Harvie recalls me now, it is as a
hobbledehoy who strode along the cliffs, shouting
Homer at the sea-mews. With all my learning, I, who
gave Margaret the name of Lalage, understood women
less than any fisherman who bandied words with them
across a boat. I remember a Yule night when both
Adam and I were at her mother&#8217;s cottage, and, as we
were leaving, he had the audacity to kiss Margaret.
She ran out of the room, and Adam swaggered off, and
when I recovered from my horror, I apologized for
what he had done. I shall never forget how her mother
looked at me, and said, &#8216;Ay, Gavin, I see they dinna
teach everything at Aberdeen.&#8217; You will not believe
it, but I walked away doubting her meaning. I thought
more of scholarship then than I do now. Adam Dishart
taught me its proper place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that is the dull man I was; and yet, though
Adam was always saying and doing the things I was
making up my mind to say and do, I think Margaret
cared more for me. Nevertheless, there was something
about him that all women seemed to find lovable, a
dash that made them send him away and then well-nigh
run after him. At any rate, I could have got her after
her mother&#8217;s death if I had been half a man. But I
went back to Aberdeen to write a poem about her, and
while I was at it Adam married her.&#8221;</p>
<p>I opened my desk and took from it a yellow manuscript.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; I said, &#8220;is the poem. You see, I never finished
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was fingering the thing grimly when Gavin&#8217;s eye
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
fell on something else in the desk. It was an ungainly
clasp-knife, as rusty as if it had spent a winter beneath
a hedge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I seem to remember that knife,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;you should remember it. Well,
after three months Adam tired of his wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>I stopped again. This was a story in which only the
pauses were eloquent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I have no right to say he tired of her. One
day, however, he sauntered away from Harvie whistling,
his dog at his heels as ever, and was not seen again for
nearly six years. When I heard of his disappearance
I packed my books in that kist and went to Harvie,
where I opened a school. You see, every one but Margaret
believed that Adam had fallen over the cliffs and
been drowned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the dog?&#8221; said Gavin.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were all sure that, if he had fallen over, it had
jumped after him. The fisher-folk said that he could
have left his shadow behind as easily as it. Yet Margaret
thought for long that he had tired of Harvie
merely and gone back to sea, and not until two years
had passed would she marry me. We lived in Adam&#8217;s
house. It was so near the little school that when I
opened the window in summer-time she could hear the
drone of our voices. During the weeks before you were
born I kept that window open all day long, and often I
went to it and waved my hand to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes, when she was washing or baking, I
brought you to the school. The only quarrel she and I
ever had was about my teaching you the Lord&#8217;s Prayer
in Greek as soon as you could say father and mother.
It was to be a surprise for her on your second birthday.
On that day, while she was ironing, you took hold of
her gown to steady yourself, and began,
&#8216;<span lang="el" title="Pater êmôn ho en tois ouranois">&#928;&#8049;&#964;&#949;&#961; &#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957; &#8001; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span>&#8217;
and to me, behind the door, it was music.
But at
<span lang="el" title="agiasthêtô">&#7937;&#947;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#7968;&#964;&#969;</span>,
of which you made two syllables, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
cried, and Margaret snatched you up, thinking this was
some new ailment. After I had explained to her that
it was the Lord&#8217;s Prayer in Greek, she would let me
take you to the school-house no more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much longer could I have taken you in any
case, for already we are at the day when Adam Dishart
came back. It was the 7th of September, and all the
week most of the women in Harvie had been setting
off at dawn to the harvest fields and straggling home at
nights, merry and with yellow corn in their hair. I
had sat on in the school-house that day after my pupils
were gone. I still meant to be a minister, and I was
studying Hebrew, and so absorbed in my book that as
the daylight went, I followed it step by step as far as
my window, and there I read, without knowing, until I
chanced to look up, that I had left my desk. I have
not opened that book since.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the window I saw you on the waste ground
that separated the school from our home. You were
coming to me on your hands and feet, and stopping now
and again to look back at your mother, who was at the
door, laughing and shaking her fist at you. I beckoned
to you, and took the book back to my desk to lock it up.
While my head was inside the desk I heard the school-house
door pushed open, and thinking it was you I
smiled, without looking up. Then something touched
my hand, and I still thought it was you; but I looked
down, and I saw Adam Dishart&#8217;s black dog.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not move. It looked up at me and wagged its
tail. Then it drew back&mdash;I suppose because I had no
words for it. I watched it run half-round the room
and stop and look at me again. Then it slunk out.</p>
<p>&#8220;All that time one of my hands had been holding the
desk open. Now the lid fell. I put on my bonnet and
went to the door. You were only a few yards away,
with flowers in your fist. Margaret was laughing still.
I walked round the school and there was no dog visible.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
Margaret nodded to me, meaning that I should bring
you home. You thrust the flowers into my hand, but
they fell. I stood there, dazed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I walked with you some way across the
waste ground. Then I dropped your hand and strode
back to the school. I went down on my knees, looking
for marks of a dog&#8217;s paws, and I found them.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I came out again your mother was no longer
at our door, and you were crying because I had left
you. I passed you and walked straight to the house.
Margaret was skinning rushes for wicks. There must
have been fear in my face, for as soon as she saw it she
ran to the door to see if you were still alive. She
brought you in with her, and so had strength to cry,
&#8216;What is it? Speak!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Come away,&#8217; I said, &#8216;come away,&#8217; and I was drawing
her to the door, but she pressed me into a chair.
I was up again at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Margaret,&#8217; I said, &#8216;ask no questions. Put on your
bonnet, give me the boy, and let us away.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not take my eyes off the door, and she was
walking to it to look out when I barred the way with
my arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What have you seen?&#8217; she cried; and then, as I
only pointed to her bonnet, she turned to you, and you
said, &#8216;Was it the black dog, father?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gavin, then she knew; and I stood helpless and
watched my wife grow old. In that moment she lost
the sprightliness I loved the more because I had none
of it myself, and the bloom went from her face never to
return.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He has come back,&#8217; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told her what I had seen, and while I spoke she
put on her bonnet, and I exulted, thinking&mdash;and then
she took off her bonnet, and I knew she would not go
away with me.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Margaret,&#8217; I cried, &#8216;I am that bairn&#8217;s father.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Adam&#8217;s my man,&#8217; she said, and at that I gave her
a look for which God might have struck me dead.
But instead of blaming me she put her arms round my
neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;After that we said very little. We sat at opposite
sides of the fire, waiting for him, and you played on
the floor. The harvesters trooped by, and there was a
fiddle; and when it stopped, long stillness, and then a
step. It was not Adam. You fell asleep, and we
could hear nothing but the sea. There was a harvest
moon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once a dog ran past the door, and we both rose.
Margaret pressed her hands on her breast. Sometimes
she looked furtively at me, and I knew her thoughts.
To me it was only misery that had come, but to her it
was shame, so that when you woke and climbed into
her lap she shivered at your touch. I could not look
at her after that, for there was a horror of me growing
in her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten o&#8217;clock struck, and then again there was no
sound but the sea pouring itself out on the beach. It
was long after this, when to me there was still no other
sound, that Margaret screamed, and you hid behind
her. Then I heard it.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Gavin,&#8217; Margaret said to me, &#8216;be a good man all
your life.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was louder now, and then it stopped. Above the
wash of the sea we heard another sound&mdash;a sharp tap,
tap. You said, &#8216;I know what sound that is; it&#8217;s a man
knocking the ashes out of his pipe against his boot.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the dog pushed the door off the latch, and
Adam lurched in. He was not drunk, but he brought
the smell of drink into the room with him. He was
grinning like one bringing rare news, and before she
could shrink back or I could strike him he had Margaret
in his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Lord, lass,&#8217; he said, with many jovial oaths, &#8216;to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
think I&#8217;m back again! There, she&#8217;s swounded. What
folks be women, to be sure.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We thought you were dead, Adam,&#8221; she said,
coming to.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Bless your blue eyes,&#8217; he answered gleefully;
&#8216;often I says to myself, &#8220;Meggy will be thinking I&#8217;m
with the fishes,&#8221; and then I chuckles.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where have you been all this time?&#8217; I demanded
sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Gavin,&#8217; he said effusively, &#8216;your hand. And don&#8217;t
look so feared, man; I bear no malice for what you&#8217;ve
done. I heard all about it at the Cross Anchors.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where have you been these five years and a half?&#8217;
I repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where have I no been, lad?&#8217; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;At Harvie,&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Right you are,&#8217; said he good-naturedly. &#8216;Meggie,
I had no intention of leaving you that day, though
I was yawning myself to death in Harvie; but I sees a
whaler, and I thinks, &#8220;That&#8217;s a tidy boat, and I&#8217;m a
tidy man, and if they&#8217;ll take me and the dog, off we
go.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You never wrote to me,&#8217; Margaret said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I meant to send you some scrapes,&#8217; he answered,
&#8216;but it wasna till I changed ships that I had the chance,
and then I minds, &#8220;Meggy kens I&#8217;m no hand with the
pen.&#8221; But I swear I often thought of you, lass; and
look you here, that&#8217;s better than letters, and so is this
and every penny of it is yours.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He flung two bags of gold upon the table, and the
chink brought you out from behind your mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hallo!&#8217; Adam cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He is mine,&#8217; I said. &#8216;Gavin, come here.&#8217; But
Margaret held you back.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Here&#8217;s a go,&#8217; Adam muttered, and scratched his
head. Then he slapped his thigh. &#8216;Gavin,&#8217; he said,
in his friendliest way, &#8216;we&#8217;ll toss for him.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He pulled the knife that is now in my desk from
his pocket, spat on it, and flung it up. &#8216;Dry, the kid&#8217;s
ours, Meggy,&#8217; he explained; &#8216;wet, he goes to Gavin.&#8217;
I clinched my fist to&mdash;&mdash;But what was the use? He
caught the knife, and showed it to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Dry,&#8217; he said triumphantly; &#8216;so he is ours, Meggy.
Kiddy, catch the knife. It is yours; and, mind, you
have changed dads. And now that we have settled
that, Gavin, there&#8217;s my hand again.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I went away and left them, and I never saw Margaret
again until the day you brought her to Thrums.
But I saw you once, a few days after Adam came back.
I was in the school-house, packing my books, and you
were playing on the waste ground. I asked you how
your mother was, and you said, &#8216;She&#8217;s fleid to come to the
door till you gang awa, and my father&#8217;s buying a boat.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m your father,&#8217; I said; but you answered confidently:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;re no a living man. You&#8217;re just a man I
dreamed about; and I promised my mother no to dream
about you again.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am your father,&#8217; I repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;My father&#8217;s awa buying a fishing-boat,&#8217; you insisted;
&#8216;and when I speir at my mother whaur my first father
is, she says I&#8217;m havering.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Gavin Ogilvy is your name,&#8217; I said. &#8216;No,&#8217; you answered,
&#8216;I have a new name. My mother telled me my
name is aye to be Gavin Dishart now. She telled me,
too, to fling awa this knife my father gave me, and I&#8217;ve
flung it awa a lot o&#8217; times, but I aye pick it up again.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Give it to me,&#8217; I said, with the wicked thoughts of
a fool in my head.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is how your knife came into my possession. I
left Harvie that night in the carrier&#8217;s cart, but I had not
the heart to return to college. Accident brought me
here, and I thought it a fitting place in which to bury
myself from Margaret.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Chapter Thirty-Seven.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />SECOND JOURNEY OF THE DOMINIE TO THRUMS DURING THE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Here was a nauseous draught for me. Having finished
my tale, I turned to Gavin for sympathy; and,
behold, he had been listening for the cannon instead of
to my final words. So, like an old woman at her hearth,
we warm our hands at our sorrows and drop in faggots,
and each thinks his own fire a sun, in presence of which
all other fires should go out. I was soured to see Gavin
prove this, and then I could have laughed without
mirth, for had not my bitterness proved it too?</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; I said, rising, &#8220;whether Margaret is to
hold up her head henceforth lies no longer with me, but
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not to that he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have suffered long, Mr. Ogilvy,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Father,&#8221; he added, wringing my hand. I called him
son; but it was only an exchange of musty words that
we had found too late. A father is a poor estate to
come into at two and twenty.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have been told of this,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your mother did right, sir,&#8221; I answered slowly, but
he shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you have misjudged her,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Doubtless
while my fa&mdash;, while Adam Dishart lived, she
could only think of you with pain; but after his
death&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After his death,&#8221; I said quietly, &#8220;I was still so horrible
to her that she left Harvie without letting a soul
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
know whither she was bound. She dreaded my following
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stranger to me,&#8221; he said, after a pause, &#8220;than even
your story is her being able to keep it from me. I believed
no thought ever crossed her mind that she did not
let me share.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And none, I am sure, ever did,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;save
that, and such thoughts as a woman has with God only.
It was my lot to bring disgrace on her. She thought it
nothing less, and she has hidden it all these years for
your sake, until now it is not burdensome. I suppose
she feels that God has taken the weight off her. Now
you are to put a heavier burden in its place.&#8221;</p>
<p>He faced me boldly, and I admire him for it now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot admit,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that I did wrong in forgetting
my mother for that fateful quarter of an hour.
Babbie and I loved each other, and I was given the
opportunity of making her mine or losing her forever.
Have you forgotten that all this tragedy you have told
me of only grew out of your own indecision? I took
the chance that you let slip by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had not forgotten,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;What else made
me tell you last night that Babbie was in Nanny&#8217;s
house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But now you are afraid&mdash;now when the deed is done,
when for me there can be no turning back. Whatever
be the issue, I should be a cur to return to Thrums
without my wife. Every minute I feel my strength
returning, and before you reach Thrums I will have set
out to the Spittal.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was nothing to say after that. He came with
me in the rain as far as the dike, warning me against
telling his people what was not true.</p>
<p>&#8220;My first part,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;will be to send word to
your mother that you are in safety. After that I must
see Whamond. Much depends on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not go to my mother?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Not so long as she has a roof over her head,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;but that may not be for long.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, I think, we parted&mdash;each soon to forget the other
in a woman.</p>
<p>But I had not gone far when I heard something that
stopped me as sharply as if it had been McKenzie&#8217;s
hand once more on my shoulder. For a second the
noise appalled me, and then, before the echo began, I
knew it must be the Spittal cannon. My only thought
was one of thankfulness. Now Gavin must see the wisdom
of my reasoning. I would wait for him until he was
able to come with me to Thrums. I turned back, and
in my haste I ran through water I had gone round before.</p>
<p>I was too late. He was gone, and into the rain I
shouted his name in vain. That he had started for the
Spittal there could be no doubt; that he would ever
reach it was less certain. The earl&#8217;s collie was still
crouching by the fire, and, thinking it might be a guide
to him, I drove the brute to the door, and chased it
in the direction he probably had taken. Not until it
had run from me did I resume my own journey. I do
not need to be told that you who read would follow
Gavin now rather than me; but you must bear with the
dominie for a little while yet, as I see no other way
of making things clear.</p>
<p>In some ways I was not ill-equipped for my attempt.
I do not know any one of our hillsides as it is known to
the shepherd, to whom every rabbit-hole and glimmer
of mica is a landmark; but he, like his flock, has only
to cross a dike to find himself in a strange land, while
I have been everywhere in the glen.</p>
<p>In the foreground the rain slanted, transparent till it
reached the ground, where a mist seemed to blow it
along as wind ruffles grass. In the distance all was a
driving mist. I have been out for perhaps an hour in
rains as wetting, and I have watched floods from my
window, but never since have I known the fifth part of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
a season&#8217;s rainfall in eighteen hours; and if there
should be the like here again, we shall be found better
prepared for it. Men have been lost in the glen
in mists so thick that they could plunge their fingers
out of sight in it as into a meal girnel; but this mist
never came within twenty yards of me. I was surrounded
by it, however, as if I was in a round tent; and
out of this tent I could not walk, for it advanced with
me. On the other side of this screen were horrible
noises, at whose cause I could only guess, save now and
again when a tongue of water was shot at my feet, or
great stones came crashing through the canvas of mist.
Then I ran wherever safety prompted, and thus tangled
my bearings until I was like that one in the child&#8217;s
game who is blindfolded and turned round three times
that he may not know east from west.</p>
<p>Once I stumbled over a dead sheep and a living
lamb; and in a clump of trees which puzzled me&mdash;for
they were where I thought no trees should be&mdash;a wood-pigeon
flew to me, but struck my breast with such force
that I picked it up dead. I saw no other living thing,
though half a dozen times I must have passed within
cry of farmhouses. At one time I was in a cornfield,
where I had to lift my hands to keep them out of water,
and a dread filled me that I had wandered in a circle, and
was still on Waster Lunny&#8217;s land. I plucked some corn
and held it to my eyes to see if it was green; but it was
yellow, and so I knew that at last I was out of the glen.</p>
<p>People up here will complain if I do not tell how I
found the farmer of Green Brae&#8217;s fifty pounds. It is
one of the best-remembered incidents of the flood, and
happened shortly after I got out of the cornfield. A
house rose suddenly before me, and I was hastening to
it when as suddenly three of its walls fell. Before my
mind could give a meaning to what my eyes told it, the
water that had brought down the house had lifted me
off my feet and flung me among waves. That would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
have been the last of the dominie had I not struck
against a chest, then halfway on its voyage to the sea.
I think the lid gave way under me; but that is surmise,
for from the time the house fell till I was on the
river in a kist that was like to be my coffin, is almost a
blank. After what may have been but a short journey,
though I had time in it to say my prayers twice, we
stopped, jammed among fallen trees; and seeing a bank
within reach, I tried to creep up it. In this there
would have been little difficulty had not the contents of
the kist caught in my feet and held on to them, like
living things afraid of being left behind. I let down
my hands to disentangle my feet, but failed; and then,
grown desperate, I succeeded in reaching firm ground,
dragging I knew not what after me. It proved to be a
pillow-slip. Green Brae still shudders when I tell him
that my first impulse was to leave the pillow-slip unopened.
However, I ripped it up, for to undo the wet
strings that had ravelled round my feet would have
wearied even a man with a needle to pick open the
knots; and among broken gimlets, the head of a grape,
and other things no beggar would have stolen, I found
a tin canister containing fifty pounds. Waster Lunny
says that this should have made a religious man of
Green Brae, and it did to this extent, that he called the
fall of the cotter&#8217;s house providential. Otherwise the
cotter, at whose expense it may be said the money was
found, remains the more religious man of the two.</p>
<p>At last I came to the Kelpie&#8217;s brig, and I could have
wept in joy (and might have been better employed),
when, like everything I saw on that journey, it broke
suddenly through the mist, and seemed to run at me
like a living monster. Next moment I ran back, for as
I stepped upon the bridge I saw that I had been about
to walk into the air. What was left of the Kelpie&#8217;s
brig ended in mid-stream. Instead of thanking God
for the light without which I should have gone abruptly
to my death, I sat down miserable and hopeless.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></div>
<p>Presently I was up and trudging to the Loups of
Malcolm. At the Loups the river runs narrow and deep
between cliffs, and the spot is so called because one
Malcolm jumped across it when pursued by wolves.
Next day he returned boastfully to look at his jump,
and gazing at it turned dizzy and fell into the river.
Since that time chains have been hung across the Loups
to reduce the distance between the farms of Carwhimple
and Keep-What-You-Can from a mile to a hundred
yards. You must cross the chains on your breast.
They were suspended there by Rob Angus, who was
also the first to breast them.</p>
<p>But I never was a Rob Angus. When my pupils
practise what they call the high jump, two small boys
hold a string aloft, and the bigger ones run at it gallantly
until they reach it, when they stop meekly and
creep beneath. They will repeat this twenty times,
and yet never, when they start for the string, seem to
know where their courage will fail. Nay, they will
even order the small boys to hold the string higher.
I have smiled at this, but it was the same courage while
the difficulty is far off that took me to the Loups. At
sight of them I turned away.</p>
<p>I prayed to God for a little of the mettle of other
men, and He heard me, for with my eyes shut I seemed
to see Margaret beckoning from across the abyss as if
she had need of me. Then I rose calmly and tested
the chains, and crossed them on my breast. Many have
done it with the same danger, at which they laugh, but
without that vision I should have held back.</p>
<p>I was now across the river, and so had left the chance
of drowning behind, but I was farther from Thrums
than when I left the school-house, and this countryside
was almost unknown to me. The mist had begun to
clear, so that I no longer wandered into fields; but
though I kept to the roads, I could not tell that they
led toward Thrums, and in my exhaustion I had often
to stand still. Then to make a new start in the mud
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
was like pulling stakes out of the ground. So long as
the rain faced me I thought I could not be straying far;
but after an hour I lost this guide, for a wind rose that
blew it in all directions.</p>
<p>In another hour, when I should have been drawing
near Thrums, I found myself in a wood, and here I
think my distress was greatest; nor is this to be marvelled
at, for instead of being near Thrums, I was listening
to the monotonous roar of the sea. I was too
spent to reason, but I knew that I must have travelled
direct east, and must be close to the German Ocean.
I remember putting my back against a tree and shutting
my eyes, and listening to the lash of the waves against
the beach, and hearing the faint toll of a bell, and
wondering listlessly on what lighthouse it was ringing.
Doubtless I would have lain down to sleep forever had
I not heard another sound near at hand. It was the
knock of a hammer on wood, and might have been a
fisherman mending his boat. The instinct of self-preservation
carried me to it, and presently I was at a
little house. A man was standing in the rain, hammering
new hinges to the door; and though I did not
recognize him, I saw with bewilderment that the
woman at his side was Nanny.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the dominie,&#8221; she cried, and her brother added:</p>
<p>&#8220;Losh, sir, you hinna the look o&#8217; a living man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nanny,&#8221; I said, in perplexity, &#8220;what are you doing
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whaur else should I be?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>I pressed my hands over my eyes, crying, &#8220;Where
am I?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanny shrank from me, but Sanders said, &#8220;Has the
rain driven you gyte, man? You&#8217;re in Thrums.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the sea,&#8221; I said, distrusting him. &#8220;I hear it.
Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the wind in Windyghoul,&#8221; Sanders answered,
looking at me queerly. &#8220;Come awa into the house.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>Hardly had I crossed the threshold of the mudhouse
when such a sickness came over me that I could not
have looked up, though Nanny&#8217;s voice had suddenly
changed to Margaret&#8217;s. Vaguely I knew that Nanny
had put the kettle on the fire&mdash;a woman&#8217;s first thought
when there is illness in the house&mdash;and as I sat with my
hands over my face I heard the water dripping from
my clothes to the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is that bell ringing?&#8221; I asked at last, ignoring
all questions and speaking through my fingers. An
artist, I suppose, could paint all expression out of a
human face. The sickness was having that effect on
my voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Auld Licht bell,&#8221; Sanders said; &#8220;and it&#8217;s
almost as fearsome to listen to as last nicht&#8217;s rain. I
wish I kent what they&#8217;re ringing it for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish no sic things,&#8221; said Nanny nervously.
&#8220;There&#8217;s things it&#8217;s best to put off kenning as lang as
we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that ill-cleakit witch, Effie McBean, that makes
Nanny speak so doleful,&#8221; Sanders told me. &#8220;There
was to be a prayer-meeting last nicht, but Mr. Dishart
never came to &#8217;t, though they rang till they wraxed
their arms; and now Effie says it&#8217;ll ring on by itsel&#8217; till
he&#8217;s brocht hame a corp. The hellicat says the rain&#8217;s a
dispensation to drown him in for neglect o&#8217; duty. Sal,
I would think little o&#8217; the Lord if He needed to create
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
a new sea to drown one man in. Nanny, yon cuttie,
that&#8217;s no swearing; I defy you to find a single lonely
oath in what I&#8217;ve said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind Effie McBean,&#8221; I interposed. &#8220;What
are the congregation saying about the minister&#8217;s
absence?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We ken little except what Effie telled us,&#8221; Nanny
answered. &#8220;I was at Tilliedrum yestreen, meeting
Sanders as he got out o&#8217; the gaol, and that awfu onding
began when we was on the Bellies Braes. We
focht our way through it, but not a soul did we meet;
and wha would gang out the day that can bide at hame?
Ay, but Effie says it&#8217;s kent in Thrums that Mr. Dishart
has run off wi&#8217;&mdash;wi&#8217; an Egyptian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re waur than her, Nanny,&#8221; Sanders said
roughly, &#8220;for you hae twa reasons for kenning better.
In the first place, has Mr. Dishart no keeped you in
siller a&#8217; the time I was awa? and for another, have I no
been at the manse?&#8221;</p>
<p>My head rose now.</p>
<p>&#8220;He gaed to the manse,&#8221; Nanny explained, &#8220;to thank
Mr. Dishart for being so good to me. Ay, but Jean
wouldna let him in. I&#8217;m thinking that looks gey gray.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever was her reason,&#8221; Sanders admitted, &#8220;Jean
wouldna open the door; but I keeked in at the parlor
window, and saw Mrs. Dishart in&#8217;t looking very cosy-like
and lauching; and do you think I would hae seen
that if ill had come ower the minister?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if Margaret knew of it,&#8221; I said to myself, and
wondered at Whamond&#8217;s forbearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;She had a skein o&#8217; worsted stretched out on her
hands,&#8221; Sanders continued, &#8220;and a young leddy was
winding it. I didna see her richt, but she wasna a
Thrums leddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Effie McBean says she&#8217;s his intended, come to call
him to account,&#8221; Nanny said; but I hardly listened,
for I saw that I must hurry to Tammas Whamond&#8217;s.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
Nanny followed me to the gate with her gown pulled
over her head, and said excitedly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dominie, I warrant it&#8217;s true. It&#8217;ll be Babbie.
Sanders doesna suspect, because I&#8217;ve telled him nothing
about her. Oh, what&#8217;s to be done? They were
baith so good to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could only tell her to keep what she knew to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Rob Dow come back?&#8221; I called out after I had
started.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whaur frae?&#8221; she replied; and then I remembered
that all these things had happened while Nanny was at
Tilliedrum. In this life some of the seven ages are
spread over two decades, and others pass as quickly as
a stage play. Though a fifth of a season&#8217;s rain had
fallen in a night and a day, it had scarcely kept pace
with Gavin.</p>
<p>I hurried to the town by the Roods. That brae was
as deserted as the country roads, except where children
had escaped from their mothers to wade in it. Here
and there dams were keeping the water away from one
door to send it with greater volume to another, and at
points the ground had fallen in. But this I noticed
without interest. I did not even realize that I was
holding my head painfully to the side where it had been
blown by the wind and glued by the rain. I have
never held my head straight since that journey.</p>
<p>Only a few looms were going, their pedals in water.
I was addressed from several doors and windows, once
by Charles Yuill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinna pretend,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you&#8217;ve walked in
frae the school-house alane. The rain chased me into
this house yestreen, and here it has keeped me, though
I bide no further awa than Tillyloss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charles,&#8221; I said in a low voice, &#8220;why is the Auld
Licht bell ringing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hae you no heard about Mr. Dishart?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Oh, man! that&#8217;s Lang Tammas in the kirk by himsel&#8217;,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
tearing at the bell to bring the folk thegither to depose
the minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of going to Whamond&#8217;s house in the school
wynd I hastened down the Banker&#8217;s close to the kirk,
and had almost to turn back, so choked was the close
with floating refuse. I could see the bell swaying, but
the kirk was locked, and I battered on the door to no
purpose. Then, remembering that <ins title='Was Henry'>Hendry</ins> Munn lived
in Coutt&#8217;s trance, I set off for his house. He saw me
crossing the square, but would not open his door until
I was close to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I open,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;squeeze through quick&#8221;;
but though I did his bidding, a rush of water darted in
before me. Hendry reclosed the door by flinging
himself against it.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I saw you crossing the square,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it
was surprise enough to cure the hiccup.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hendry,&#8221; I replied instantly, &#8220;why is the Auld
Licht bell ringing?&#8221;</p>
<p>He put his finger to his lip. &#8220;I see,&#8221; he said imperturbably,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve met our folk in the glen and heard
frae them about the minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What folk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mair than half the congregation,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I
started for Glen Quharity twa hours syne to help the
farmers. You didna see them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; they must have been on the other side of the
river.&#8221; Again that question forced my lips, &#8220;Why is
the bell ringing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Canny, dominie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;till we&#8217;re up the stair.
Mysy Moncur&#8217;s lug&#8217;s at her keyhole listening to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie, Hendry Munn,&#8221; cried an invisible woman.
The voice became more plaintive: &#8220;I ken a heap, Hendry,
so you may as well tell me a&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lick away at the bone you hae,&#8221; the shoemaker replied
heartlessly, and conducted me to his room up one
of the few inside stairs then in Thrums. Hendry&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
oddest furniture was five boxes, fixed to the wall at
such a height that children could climb into them from
a high stool. In these his bairns slept, and so space
was economized. I could never laugh at the arrangement,
as I knew that Betty had planned it on her
deathbed for her man&#8217;s sake. Five little heads bobbed
up in their beds as I entered, but more vexing to me
was Wearyworld on a stool.</p>
<p>&#8220;In by, dominie,&#8221; he said sociably. &#8220;Sal, you
needna fear burning wi&#8217; a&#8217; that water on you. You&#8217;re
in mair danger o&#8217; coming a-boil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to speak to you alone, Hendry,&#8221; I said
bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You winna put me out, Hendry?&#8221; the alarmed
policeman entreated. &#8220;Mind, you said in sic weather
you would be friendly to a brute beast. Ay, ay, dominie,
what&#8217;s your news? It&#8217;s welcome, be it good or
bad. You would meet the townsfolk in the glen, and
they would tell you about Mr. Dishart. What, you
hinna heard? Oh, sirs, he&#8217;s a lost man. There would
hae been a meeting the day to depose him if so many
hadna gaen to the glen. But the morn&#8217;ll do as weel.
The very women is cursing him, and the laddies has
begun to gather stanes. He&#8217;s married on an Egyp&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hendry!&#8221; I cried, like one giving an order.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wearyworld, step!&#8221; said Hendry sternly, and then
added soft-heartedly: &#8220;Here&#8217;s a bit news that&#8217;ll open
Mysy Moncur&#8217;s door to you. You can tell her frae me
that the bell&#8217;s ringing just because I forgot to tie it up
last nicht, and the wind&#8217;s shaking it, and I winna gang
out in the rain to stop it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; the policeman said, looking at me sulkily,
&#8220;she may open her door for that, but it&#8217;ll no let me in.
Tell me mair. Tell me wha the leddy at the manse is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out you go,&#8221; answered Hendry. &#8220;Once she opens
the door, you can shove your foot in, and syne she&#8217;s in
your power.&#8221; He pushed Wearyworld out, and came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
back to me, saying, &#8220;It was best to tell him the truth,
to keep him frae making up lies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But is it the truth? I was told Lang Tammas&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I ken that story; but Tammas has other work
on hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then tie up the bell at once, Hendry,&#8221; I urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;I canna,&#8221; he answered gravely. &#8220;Tammas took the
keys o&#8217; the kirk fram me yestreen, and winna gie them
up. He says the bell&#8217;s being rung by the hand o&#8217; God.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he been at the manse? Does Mrs. Dishart
know&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been at the manse twa or three times, but Jean
barred him out. She&#8217;ll let nobody in till the minister
comes back, and so the mistress kens nothing. But
what&#8217;s the use o&#8217; keeping it frae her ony langer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every use,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;None,&#8221; answered Hendry sadly. &#8220;Dominie, the
minister was married to the Egyptian on the hill last
nicht, and Tammas was witness. Not only were they
married, but they&#8217;ve run aff thegither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are wrong, Hendry,&#8221; I assured him, telling as
much as I dared. &#8220;I left Mr. Dishart in my house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! But if that is so, how did he no come back
wi&#8217; you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he was nearly drowned in the flood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be wi&#8217; him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hendry&#8217;s face lit up dimly with joy, and then he
shook his head. &#8220;Tammas was witness,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Can you deny the marriage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All I ask of you,&#8221; I answered guardedly, &#8220;is to suspend
judgment until the minister returns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There can be nothing done, at ony rate,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;till the folk themsel&#8217;s come back frae the glen; and I
needna tell you how glad we would a&#8217; be to be as fond
o&#8217; him as ever. But Tammas was witness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have pity on his mother, man.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve done the best for her we could,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;We prigged wi&#8217; Tammas no to gang to the manse till
we was sure the minister was living. &#8216;For if he has
been drowned,&#8217; we said, &#8216;his mother need never ken
what we were thinking o&#8217; doing.&#8217; Ay, and we&#8217;re sorry
for the young leddy, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What young lady is this you all talk of?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s his intended. Ay, you needna start. She
has come a&#8217; the road frae Glasgow to challenge him
about the gypsy. The pitiful thing is that Mrs. Dishart
lauched awa her fears, and now they&#8217;re baith waiting
for his return, as happy as ignorance can make them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no such lady,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is,&#8221; he answered doggedly, &#8220;for she came
in a machine late last nicht, and I was ane o&#8217; a dozen
that baith heard and saw it through my window. It
stopped at the manse near half an hour. What&#8217;s mair,
the lady hersel&#8217; was at Sam&#8217;l Farquharson&#8217;s in the
Tenements the day for twa hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>I listened in bewilderment and fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sam&#8217;l&#8217;s bairn&#8217;s down wi&#8217; scarlet fever and like to die,
and him being a widow-man he has gone useless. You
mauna blame the wives in the Tenements for hauding
back. They&#8217;re fleid to smit their ain litlins; and as it
happens, Sam&#8217;l&#8217;s friends is a&#8217; aff to the glen. Weel, he
ran greeting to the manse for Mr. Dishart, and the lady
heard him crying to Jean through the door, and what
does she do but gang straucht to the Tenements wi&#8217;
Sam&#8217;l. Her goodness has naturally put the folk on her
side against the minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This does not prove her his intended,&#8221; I broke in.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was heard saying to Sam&#8217;l,&#8221; answered the kirk
officer, &#8220;that the minister being awa, it was her duty to
take his place. Yes, and though she little kent it, he
was already married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hendry,&#8221; I said, rising, &#8220;I must see this lady at
once. Is she still at Farquharson&#8217;s house?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She may be back again by this time. Tammas set
off for Sam&#8217;l&#8217;s as soon as he heard she was there, but he
just missed her. I left him there an hour syne. He
was waiting for her, determined to tell her all.&#8221;</p>
<p>I set off for the Tenements at once, declining Hendry&#8217;s
company. The wind had fallen, so that the bell
no longer rang, but the rain was falling doggedly.
The streets were still deserted. I pushed open the precentor&#8217;s
door in the school wynd, but there was no one
in the house. Tibbie Birse saw me, and shouted from
her door:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hae you heard o&#8217; Mr. Dishart? He&#8217;ll never daur
show face in Thrums again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without giving her a word I hastened to the Tenements.</p>
<p>&#8220;The leddy&#8217;s no here,&#8221; Sam&#8217;l Farquharson told me,
&#8220;and Tammas is back at the manse again, trying to
force his way in.&#8221;</p>
<p>From Sam&#8217;l, too, I turned, with no more than a
groan; but he cried after me, &#8220;Perdition on the man
that has played that leddy false.&#8221;</p>
<p>Had Margaret been at her window she must have
seen me, so recklessly did I hurry up the minister&#8217;s
road, with nothing in me but a passion to take Whamond
by the throat. He was not in the garden. The
kitchen door was open. Jean was standing at it with
her apron to her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tammas Whamond?&#8221; I demanded, and my face
completed the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re ower late,&#8221; she wailed. &#8220;He&#8217;s wi&#8217; her.
Oh, dominie, whaur&#8217;s the minister?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You base woman!&#8221; I cried, &#8220;why did you unbar
the door?&#8221;</p>

&#8220;IT WAS BABBIE, THOUGH NO LONGER IN A GYPSY&#8217;S DRESS.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;It was the mistress,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;She heard
him shaking it, and I had to tell her wha it was. Dominie,
it&#8217;s a&#8217; my wite! He tried to get in last nicht, and
roared threats through the door, and after he had gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
awa she speired wha I had been speaking to. I had to
tell her, but I said he had come to let her ken that the
minister was taking shelter frae the rain in a farmhouse.
Ay, I said he was to bide there till the flood gaed down,
and that&#8217;s how she has been easy a&#8217; day. I acted for
the best, but I&#8217;m sair punished now; for when she heard
Tammas at the door twa or three minutes syne, she
ordered me to let him in, so that she could thank him
for bringing the news last nicht, despite the rain.
They&#8217;re in the parlor. Oh, dominie, gang in and stop
his mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was hard. I dared not go to the parlor.
Margaret might have died at sight of me. I turned my
face from Jean.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean,&#8221; said some one, opening the inner kitchen
door, &#8220;why did you&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped, and that was what turned me round.
As she spoke I thought it was the young lady; when I
looked I saw it was Babbie, though no longer in a
gypsy&#8217;s dress. Then I knew that the young lady and
Babbie were one.</p>

<h2>Chapter Thirty-Nine.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />HOW BABBIE SPENT THE NIGHT OF AUGUST FOURTH.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>How had the Egyptian been spirited here from the
Spittal? I did not ask the question. To interest myself
in Babbie at that dire hour of Margaret&#8217;s life would
have been as impossible to me as to sit down to a book.
To others, however, it is only an old woman on whom
the parlor door of the manse has closed, only a garrulous
dominie that is in pain outside it. Your eyes are
on the young wife.</p>
<p>When Babbie was plucked off the hill, she thought as
little as Gavin that her captor was Rob Dow. Close as
he was to her, he was but a shadow until she screamed
the second time, when he pressed her to the ground and
tied his neckerchief over her mouth. Then, in the
moment that power of utterance was taken from her,
she saw the face that had startled her at Nanny&#8217;s window.
Half-carried, she was borne forward rapidly,
until some one seemed to rise out of the broom and
strike them both. They had only run against the doctor&#8217;s
trap; and huddling her into it, Dow jumped up
beside her. He tied her hands together with a cord.
For a time the horse feared the darkness in front more
than the lash behind; but when the rains became terrific,
it rushed ahead wildly&mdash;probably with its eyes
shut.</p>
<p>In three minutes Babbie went through all the degrees
of fear. In the first she thought Lord Rintoul
had kidnapped her; but no sooner had her captor resolved
himself into Dow, drunk with the events of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
day and night, than in the earl&#8217;s hands would have lain
safety. Next, Dow was forgotten in the dread of a
sudden death which he must share. And lastly, the
rain seemed to be driving all other horrors back, that it
might have her for its own. Her perils increased to
the unbearable as quickly as an iron in the fire passes
through the various stages between warmth and white
heat. Then she had to do something; and as she could
not cry out, she flung herself from the dogcart. She
fell heavily in Caddam Wood, but the rain would not
let her lie there stunned. It beat her back to consciousness,
and she sat up on her knees and listened breathlessly,
staring in the direction the trap had taken, as if
her eyes could help her ears.</p>
<p>All night, I have said, the rain poured, but those
charges only rode down the deluge at intervals, as now
and again one wave greater than the others stalks over
the sea. In the first lull it appeared to Babbie that the
storm had swept by, leaving her to Dow. Now she
heard the rubbing of the branches, and felt the torn
leaves falling on her gown. She rose to feel her way
out of the wood with her bound hands, then sank in terror,
for some one had called her name. Next moment
she was up again, for the voice was Gavin&#8217;s, who was
hurrying after her, as he thought, down Windyghoul.
He was no farther away than a whisper might have
carried on a still night, but she dared not pursue him,
for already Dow was coming back. She could not see
him, but she heard the horse whinny and the rocking of
the dogcart. Dow was now at the brute&#8217;s head, and
probably it tried to bite him, for he struck it, crying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you? Stand still till I find her.... I heard her
move this minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Babbie crouched upon a big stone and sat motionless
while he groped for her. Her breathing might have
been tied now, as well as her mouth. She heard him
feeling for her, first with his feet and then with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
hands, and swearing when his head struck against a
tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ken you&#8217;re within hearing,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;and
I&#8217;ll hae you yet. I have a gully-knife in my hand.
Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>He severed a whin-stalk with the knife, and Babbie
seemed to see the gleam of the blade.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do I mean by wanting to kill you?&#8221; he said,
as if she had asked the question. &#8220;Do you no ken wha
said to me, &#8216;Kill this woman?&#8217; It was the Lord. &#8216;I
winna kill her,&#8217; I said, &#8216;but I&#8217;ll cart her out o&#8217; the country.&#8217;
&#8216;Kill her,&#8217; says He; &#8216;why encumbereth she the
ground?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>He resumed his search, but with new tactics. &#8220;I see
you now,&#8221; he would cry, and rush forward perhaps
within a yard of her. Then she must have screamed
had she had the power. When he tied that neckerchief
round her mouth he prolonged her life.</p>
<p>Then came the second hurricane of rain, so appalling
that had Babbie&#8217;s hands been free she would have
pressed them to her ears. For a full minute she forgot
Dow&#8217;s presence. A living thing touched her face.
The horse had found her. She recoiled from it, but its
frightened head pressed heavily on her shoulder. She
rose and tried to steal away, but the brute followed, and
as the rain suddenly exhausted itself she heard the dragging
of the dogcart. She had to halt.</p>
<p>Again she heard Dow&#8217;s voice. Perhaps he had been
speaking throughout the roar of the rain. If so, it must
have made him deaf to his own words. He groped for
the horse&#8217;s head, and presently his hand touched Babbie&#8217;s
dress, then jumped from it, so suddenly had he
found her. No sound escaped him, and she was beginning
to think it possible that he had mistaken her for a
bush when his hand went over her face. He was making
sure of his discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord has delivered you into my hands,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
said in a low voice, with some awe in it. Then he
pulled her to the ground, and, sitting down beside her,
rocked himself backward and forward, his hands round
his knees. She would have bartered the world for
power to speak to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wouldna hear o&#8217; my just carting you to some
other countryside,&#8221; he said confidentially. &#8220;&#8216;The devil
would just blaw her back again,&#8217; says He, &#8216;therefore
kill her.&#8217; &#8216;And if I kill her,&#8217; I says, &#8216;they&#8217;ll hang me.&#8217;
&#8216;You can hang yoursel&#8217;,&#8217; says He. &#8216;What wi&#8217;?&#8217; I speirs.
&#8216;Wi&#8217; the reins o&#8217; the dogcart,&#8217; says He. &#8216;They would
break,&#8217; says I. &#8216;Weel, weel,&#8217; says He, &#8216;though they do
hang you, nobody&#8217;ll miss you.&#8217; &#8216;That&#8217;s true,&#8217; says I,
&#8216;and You are a just God.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood up and confronted her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prisoner at the bar,&#8221; he said, &#8220;hae ye onything to
say why sentence of death shouldna be pronounced
against you? She doesna answer. She kens death is
her deserts.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time he had forgotten probably why his victim
was dumb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prisoner at the bar, hand back to me the soul o&#8217;
Gavin Dishart. You winna? Did the devil, your master,
summon you to him and say, &#8216;Either that noble
man or me maun leave Thrums?&#8217; He did. And did
you, or did you no, drag that minister, when under
your spell, to the hill, and there marry him ower the
tongs? You did. Witnesses, Rob Dow and Tammas
Whamond.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was moving from him on her knees, meaning
when out of arm&#8217;s reach to make a dash for life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he grumbled, &#8220;or how can you expect a
fair trial? Prisoner at the bar, you have been found
guilty of witchcraft.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time his voice faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the difficulty, for witches canna die, except
by burning or drowning. There&#8217;s no blood in you for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
my knife, and your neck wouldna twist. Your master
has brocht the rain to put out a&#8217; the fires, and we&#8217;ll hae
to wait till it runs into a pool deep enough to drown
you.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder at You, God. Do You believe her
master&#8217;ll mak&#8217; the pool for her? He&#8217;ll rather stop his
rain. Mr. Dishart said You was mair powerful than
the devil, but it doesna look like it. If You had the
power, how did You no stop this woman working her
will on the minister? You kent what she was doing,
for You ken a&#8217; things. Mr. Dishart says You ken a&#8217;
things. If You do, the mair shame to You. Would a
shepherd, that could help it, let dogs worry his sheep?
Kill her! It&#8217;s fine to cry &#8216;Kill her,&#8217; but whaur&#8217;s the
bonfire, whaur&#8217;s the pool? You that made the heaven
and the earth and all that in them is, can You no set
fire to some wet whins, or change this stane into a
mill-dam?&#8221;</p>
<p>He struck the stone with his fist, and then gave a cry
of exultation. He raised the great slab in his arms
and flung it from him. In that moment Babbie might
have run away, but she fainted. Almost simultaneously
with Dow she knew this was the stone which covered
the Caddam well. When she came to, Dow was speaking,
and his voice had become solemn.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said your master was mair powerful than mine,
and I said it too, and all the time you was sitting here
wi&#8217; the very pool aneath you that I have been praying
for. Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>He dropped a stone into the well, and she heard it
strike the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you shaking at?&#8221; he said in reproof.
&#8220;Was it no yoursel&#8217; that chose the spot? Lassie, say
your prayers. Are you saying them?&#8221;</p>
<p>He put his hand over her face, to feel if her lips were
moving, and tore off the neckerchief.</p>
<p>And then again the rain came between them. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
that rain one could not think. Babbie did not know
that she had bitten through the string that tied her
hands. She planned no escape. But she flung herself
at the place where Dow had been standing. He was no
longer there, and she fell heavily, and was on her feet
again in an instant and running recklessly. Trees intercepted
her, and she thought they were Dow, and
wrestled with them. By and by she fell into Windyghoul,
and there she crouched until all her senses were
restored to her, when she remembered that she had been
married lately.</p>
<p>How long Dow was in discovering that she had escaped,
and whether he searched for her, no one knows.
After a time he jumped into the dogcart again, and
drove aimlessly through the rain. That wild journey
probably lasted two hours, and came to an abrupt end
only when a tree fell upon the trap. The horse galloped
off, but one of Dow&#8217;s legs was beneath the tree,
and there he had to lie helpless, for though the leg was
little injured, he could not extricate himself. A night
and day passed, and he believed that he must die; but
even in this plight he did not forget the man he loved.
He found a piece of slate, and in the darkness cut these
words on it with his knife:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Me being about to die, I solemnly swear I didna
see the minister marrying an Egyptian on the hill this
nicht. May I burn in Hell if this is no true.</p>
<p class='sig1'>(Signed)</p>
<p class='sig2 smcap'>&#8220;Rob Dow.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This document he put in his pocket, and so preserved
proof of what he was perjuring himself to deny.</p>

<h2>Chapter Forty.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />BABBIE AND MARGARET&mdash;DEFENCE OF THE MANSE CONTINUED.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The Egyptian was mournful in Windyghoul, up which
she had once danced and sung; but you must not think
that she still feared Dow. I felt McKenzie&#8217;s clutch on
my arm for hours after he left me, but she was far
braver than I; indeed, dangers at which I should have
shut my eyes only made hers gleam, and I suppose it
was sheer love of them that first made her play the
coquette with Gavin. If she cried now, it was not for
herself; it was because she thought she had destroyed
him. Could I have gone to her then and said that
Gavin wanted to blot out the gypsy wedding, that throbbing
little breast would have frozen at once, and the
drooping head would have been proud again, and she
would have gone away forever without another tear.</p>
<p>What do I say? I am doing a wrong to the love
these two bore each other. Babbie would not have
taken so base a message from my lips. He would have
had to say the words to her himself before she believed
them his. What would he want her to do now? was
the only question she asked herself. To follow him
was useless, for in that rain and darkness two people
might have searched for each other all night in a single
field. That he would go to the Spittal, thinking her in
Rintoul&#8217;s dogcart, she did not doubt; and his distress
was painful to her to think of. But not knowing that
the burns were in flood, she underestimated his danger.</p>
<p>Remembering that the mudhouse was near, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
groped her way to it, meaning to pass the night there;
but at the gate she turned away hastily, hearing from
the door the voice of a man she did not know to be
Nanny&#8217;s brother. She wandered recklessly a short distance,
until the rain began to threaten again, and then,
falling on her knees in the broom, she prayed to God
for guidance. When she rose she set off for the manse.</p>
<p>The rain that followed the flash of lightning had
brought Margaret to the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean, did you ever hear such a rain? It is trying to
break into the manse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I canna hear you, ma&#8217;am; is it the rain you&#8217;re
feared at?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What else could it be?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jean did not answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the minister won&#8217;t leave the church, Jean,
till this is over?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody would daur, ma&#8217;am. The rain&#8217;ll turn the
key on them all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jean forced out these words with difficulty, for she
knew that the church had been empty and the door
locked for over an hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;This rain has come as if in answer to the minister&#8217;s
prayer, Jean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasna rain like this they wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean, you would not attempt to guide the Lord&#8217;s
hand. The minister will have to reprove the people
for thinking too much of him again, for they will say
that he induced God to send the rain. To-night&#8217;s meeting
will be remembered long in Thrums.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jean shuddered, and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s mair like an ordinary
rain now, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it has put out your fire, and I wanted another
heater. Perhaps the one I have is hot enough, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret returned to the parlor, and from the
kitchen Jean could hear the heater tilted backward and
forward in the box-iron&mdash;a pleasant, homely sound
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
when there is happiness in the house. Soon she heard
a step outside, however, and it was followed by a rough
shaking of the barred door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it you, Mr. Dishart?&#8221; Jean asked nervously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me, Tammas Whamond,&#8221; the precentor answered.
&#8220;Unbar the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want? Speak low.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I winna speak low. Let me in. I hae news for the
minister&#8217;s mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What news?&#8221; demanded Jean.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean Proctor, as chief elder of the kirk I order you
to let me do my duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whaur&#8217;s the minister?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a minister no longer. He&#8217;s married a gypsy
woman and run awa wi&#8217; her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie, Tammas Whamond. I believe&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your belief&#8217;s of no consequence. Open the door,
and let me in to tell your mistress what I hae seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll hear it first frae his ain lips if she hears it
ava. I winna open the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll burst it open.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whamond flung himself at the door, and Jean, her
fingers rigid with fear, stood waiting for its fall. But
the rain came to her rescue by lashing the precentor
until even he was forced to run from it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back again,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Woe to you, Jean
Proctor, that hae denied your God this nicht.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was that speaking to you, Jean?&#8221; asked Margaret,
re-entering the kitchen. Until the rain abated
Jean did not attempt to answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was the precentor&#8217;s voice,&#8221; Margaret
said.</p>
<p>Jean was a poor hand at lying, and she stuttered in
her answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing wrong, is there?&#8221; cried Margaret,
in sudden fright. &#8220;My son&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, nothing.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></div>
<p>The words jumped from Jean to save Margaret from
falling. Now she could not take them back. &#8220;I winna
believe it o&#8217; him,&#8221; said Jean to herself. &#8220;Let them say
what they will, I&#8217;ll be true to him; and when he comes
back he&#8217;ll find her as he left her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Lang Tammas,&#8221; she answered her mistress;
&#8220;but he just came to say that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, Jean! what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;Mr. Dishart has been called to a sick-bed in the
country, ma&#8217;am&mdash;to the farm o&#8217; Look-About-You; and
as it&#8217;s sic a rain, he&#8217;s to bide there a&#8217; nicht.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Whamond came through that rain to tell me
this? How good of him. Was there any other message?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just that the minister hoped you would go straight
to your bed, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Jean, thinking to herself,
&#8220;There can be no great sin in giving her one mair
happy nicht; it may be her last.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two women talked for a short time, and then
read verse about in the parlor from the third chapter
of Mark.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first night we have been left alone in the
manse,&#8221; Margaret said, as she was retiring to her bedroom,
&#8220;and we must not grudge the minister to those
who have sore need of him. I notice that you have
barred the doors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, they&#8217;re barred. Nobody can win in the nicht.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody will want in, Jean,&#8221; Margaret said, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna ken about that,&#8221; answered Jean below her
breath. &#8220;Ay, ma&#8217;am, may you sleep for baith o&#8217; us
this nicht, for I daurna gang to my bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jean was both right and wrong, for two persons
wanted in within the next half-hour, and she opened
the door to both of them. The first to come was Babbie.</p>
<p>So long as women sit up of nights listening for a
footstep, will they flatten their faces at the window,
though all without be black. Jean had not been back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
in the kitchen for two minutes before she raised the
blind. Her eyes were close to the glass, when she saw
another face almost meet hers, as you may touch your
reflection in a mirror. But this face was not her own.
It was white and sad. Jean suppressed a cry, and let
the blind fall, as if shutting the lid on some uncanny
thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you let me in?&#8221; said a voice that might have
been only the sob of a rain-beaten wind; &#8220;I am nearly
drowned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jean stood like death; but her suppliant would not
pass on.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not afraid?&#8221; the voice continued. &#8220;Raise
the blind again, and you will see that no one need fear
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this request Jean&#8217;s hands sought each other&#8217;s
company behind her back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha are you?&#8221; she asked, without stirring. &#8220;Are
you&mdash;the woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whaur&#8217;s the minister?&#8221;</p>
<p>The rain again became wild, but this time it only
tore by the manse as if to a conflict beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you aye there? I daurna let you in till I&#8217;m
sure the mistress is bedded. Gang round to the front,
and see if there&#8217;s ony licht burning in the high west
window.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a light,&#8221; the voice said presently, &#8220;but
it was turned out as I looked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll let you in, and God kens I mean no wrang
by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Babbie entered shivering, and Jean rebarred the
door. Then she looked long at the woman whom her
master loved. Babbie was on her knees at the hearth,
holding out her hands to the dead fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a pity it&#8217;s a fause face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I look so false?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Is it true? You&#8217;re no married to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet you look as if you was fond o&#8217; him. If you
cared for him, how could you do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was why I did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And him could hae had wha he liked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave up Lord Rintoul for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Na, na; you&#8217;re the Egyptian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You judge me by my dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And soaking it is. How you&#8217;re shivering&mdash;what
neat fingers&mdash;what bonny little feet. I could near believe
what you tell me. Aff wi&#8217; these rags, an I&#8217;ll gie
you on my black frock, if&mdash;if you promise me no to
gang awa wi&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Babbie put on some clothes of Jean&#8217;s, including
the black frock, and stockings and shoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dishart cannot be back, Jean,&#8221; she said, &#8220;before
morning, and I don&#8217;t want his mother to see me till he
comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldna let you near her the nicht though you
gaed on your knees to me. But whaur is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Babbie explained why Gavin had set off for the Spittal;
but Jean shook her head incredulously, saying, &#8220;I
canna believe you&#8217;re that grand leddy, and yet ilka
time I look at you I could near believe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another minute Jean had something else to think
of, for there came a loud rap upon the front door.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Tammas Whamond back again,&#8221; she moaned;
&#8220;and if the mistress hears, she&#8217;ll tell me to let him in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall open to me,&#8221; cried a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no Tammas&#8217; word,&#8221; Jean said in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Lord Rintoul,&#8221; Babbie whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Then it&#8217;s truth you telled me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The knocking continued; a door upstairs opened, and
Margaret spoke over the banisters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you gone to bed, Jean? Some one is knocking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
at the door, and a minute ago I thought I heard a carriage
stop close by. Perhaps the farmer has driven Mr.
Dishart home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m putting on my things, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; Jean answered;
then whispered to Babbie, &#8220;What&#8217;s to be done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t go away,&#8221; Babbie answered. &#8220;You will
have to let him into the parlor, Jean. Can she see
the door from up there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but though he was in the parlor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall go to him there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make haste, Jean,&#8221; Margaret called. &#8220;If it is any
persons wanting shelter, we must give it them on such
a night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A minute, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; Jean answered. To Babbie she
whispered, &#8220;What shall I say to her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Babbie ruefully.
&#8220;Think of something, Jean. But open the door now.
Stop, let me into the parlor first.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two women stole into the parlor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me what will be the result o&#8217; his coming here,&#8221;
entreated Jean.</p>
<p>&#8220;The result,&#8221; Babbie said firmly, &#8220;will be that he
shall go away and leave me here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret heard Jean open the front door and speak
to some person or persons whom she showed into the
parlor.</p>

<h2>Chapter Forty-One.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />RINTOUL AND BABBIE&mdash;BREAKDOWN OF THE DEFENCE OF THE MANSE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;You dare to look me in the face!&#8221;</p>
<p>They were Rintoul&#8217;s words. Yet Babbie had only
ventured to look up because he was so long in speaking.
His voice was low but harsh, like a wheel on
which the brake is pressed sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to be more than the man is capable of,&#8221; he
added sourly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; Babbie exclaimed, taking fire, &#8220;that
he is afraid of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it seems; but I will drag him into the light,
wherever he is skulking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lord Rintoul strode to the door, and the brake was
off his tongue already.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go,&#8221; said Babbie coldly, &#8220;and shout and stamp
through the house; you may succeed in frightening the
women, who are the only persons in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has gone to the Spittal to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He knew I was on the hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He lost me in the darkness, and thought you had
run away with me in your trap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! So he is off to the Spittal to ask me to give
you back to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To compel you,&#8221; corrected Babbie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said the earl nervously, &#8220;that was but
mummery on the hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a marriage.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span></div>
<p>&#8220;With gypsies for witnesses. Their word would
count for less than nothing. Babbie, I am still in time
to save you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be saved. The marriage had witnesses
no court could discredit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What witnesses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. McKenzie and yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>She heard his teeth meet. When next she looked
at him, there were tears in his eyes as well as in
her own. It was perhaps the first time these two had
ever been in close sympathy. Both were grieving for
Rintoul.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so sorry,&#8221; Babbie began in a broken voice;
then stopped, because they seemed such feeble words.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are sorry,&#8221; the earl answered eagerly, &#8220;it is
not yet too late. McKenzie and I saw nothing. Come
away with me, Babbie, if only in pity for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but I don&#8217;t pity myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because this man has blinded you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he has made me see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This mummery on the hill&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you call it so? I believe God approved of
that marriage, as He could never have countenanced
yours and mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God! I never heard the word on your lips before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is his teaching, doubtless?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he told you that to do to me as you have done
was to be pleasing in God&#8217;s sight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; he knows that it was so evil in God&#8217;s sight that
I shall suffer for it always.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he has done no wrong, so there is no punishment
for him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true that he has done no wrong, but his punishment
will be worse, probably, than mine.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;YOU DARE TO LOOK ME IN THE FACE!&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said the earl, scoffing, &#8220;is not just.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is just. He has accepted responsibility for my
sins by marrying me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what form is his punishment to take?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For marrying me he will be driven from his church
and dishonored in all men&#8217;s eyes, unless&mdash;unless God
is more merciful to us than we can expect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her sincerity was so obvious that the earl could no
longer meet it with sarcasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is you I pity now,&#8221; he said, looking wonderingly
at her. &#8220;Do you not see that this man has deceived
you? Where was his boasted purity in meeting you by
stealth, as he must have been doing, and plotting to
take you from me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you knew him,&#8221; Babbie answered, &#8220;you would
not need to be told that he is incapable of that. He
thought me an ordinary gypsy until an hour ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you had so little regard for me that you waited
until the eve of what was to be our marriage, and then,
laughing at my shame, ran off to marry him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not so bad as that,&#8221; Babbie answered, and told
him what had brought her to Thrums. &#8220;I had no
thought but of returning to you, nor he of keeping me
from you. We had said good-by at the mudhouse
door&mdash;and then we heard your voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And my voice was so horrible to you that it drove
you to this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I love him so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>What more could Babbie answer? These words told
him that, if love commands, home, the friendships of a
lifetime, kindnesses incalculable, are at once as naught.
Nothing is so cruel as love if a rival challenges it to
combat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why could you not love me, Babbie?&#8221; said the earl
sadly. &#8220;I have done so much for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was little he had done for her that was not selfish.
Men are deceived curiously in such matters. When
they add a new wing to their house, they do not call the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
action virtue; but if they give to a fellow-creature for
their own gratification, they demand of God a good
mark for it. Babbie, however, was in no mood to make
light of the earl&#8217;s gifts, and at his question she shook
her head sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it because I am too&mdash;old?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the only time he ever spoke of his age to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, it is not that,&#8221; she replied hastily, &#8220;I love
Mr. Dishart&mdash;because he loves me, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I not loved you always?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; Babbie answered simply. &#8220;If you had,
perhaps then I should have loved you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Babbie,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;if ever man loved woman,
and showed it by the sacrifices he made for her, I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Babbie said, &#8220;you don&#8217;t understand what it is.
Ah! I did not mean to hurt you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t know what it is, what is it?&#8221; he asked,
almost humbly. &#8220;I scarcely know you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is it,&#8221; said Babbie.</p>
<p>She gave him back his ring, and then he broke down
pitifully. Doubtless there was good in him, but I saw
him only once; and with nothing to contrast against it, I
may not now attempt to breathe life into the dust of his
senile passion. These were the last words that passed
between him and Babbie:</p>
<p>&#8220;There was nothing,&#8221; he said wistfully, &#8220;in this wide
world that you could not have had by asking me for it.
Was not that love?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;What right have I to everything
I cry for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should never have had a care had you married
me. That is love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not. I want to share my husband&#8217;s cares, as I
expect him to share mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would have humored you in everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You always did: as if a woman&#8217;s mind were for
laughing at, like a baby&#8217;s passions.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You had your passions, too, Babbie. Yet did I ever
chide you for them? That was love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it was contempt. Oh,&#8221; she cried passionately,
&#8220;what have not you men to answer for who talk of love
to a woman when her face is all you know of her; and
her passions, her aspirations, are for kissing to sleep,
her very soul a plaything? I tell you, Lord Rintoul,
and it is all the message I send back to the gentlemen
at the Spittal who made love to me behind your back,
that this is a poor folly, and well calculated to rouse
the wrath of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Jean&#8217;s ear had been to the parlor keyhole for
a time, but some message she had to take to Margaret,
and what she risked saying was this:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Lord Rintoul and a party that has been catched
in the rain, and he would be obliged to you if you could
gie his bride shelter for the nicht.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus the distracted servant thought to keep Margaret&#8217;s
mind at rest until Gavin came back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Rintoul!&#8221; exclaimed Margaret. &#8220;What a pity
Gavin has missed him. Of course she can stay here.
Did you say I had gone to bed? I should not know
what to say to a lord. But ask her to come up to me
after he has gone&mdash;and, Jean, is the parlor looking
tidy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lord Rintoul having departed, Jean told Babbie how
she had accounted to Margaret for his visit. &#8220;And she
telled me to gie you dry claethes and her compliments,
and would you gang up to the bedroom and see her?&#8221;</p>
<p>Very slowly Babbie climbed the stairs. I suppose
she is the only person who was ever afraid of Margaret.
Her first knock on the bedroom door was so soft that
Margaret, who was sitting up in bed, did not hear it.
When Babbie entered the room, Margaret&#8217;s first thought
was that there could be no other so beautiful as this,
and her second was that the stranger seemed even more
timid than herself. After a few minutes&#8217; talk she laid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
aside her primness, a weapon she had drawn in self-defence
lest this fine lady should not understand the
grandeur of a manse, and at a &#8220;Call me Babbie, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221; she smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what some other person calls you,&#8221; said
Margaret archly. &#8220;Do you know that he took twenty
minutes to say good-night? My dear,&#8221; she added hastily,
misinterpreting Babbie&#8217;s silence, &#8220;I should have
been sorry had he taken one second less. Every tick
of the clock was a gossip, telling me how he loves
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the dim light a face that begged for pity was
turned to Margaret.</p>
<p>&#8220;He does love you, Babbie?&#8221; she asked, suddenly
doubtful.</p>
<p>Babbie turned away her face, then shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you love him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Babbie shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear,&#8221; cried Margaret, in distress, &#8220;if this
is so, are you not afraid to marry him?&#8221;</p>
<p>She knew now that Babbie was crying, but she did
not know why Babbie could not look her in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;There may be times,&#8221; Babbie said, most woeful that
she had not married Rintoul, &#8220;when it is best to marry
a man though we do not love him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are wrong, Babbie,&#8221; Margaret answered
gravely; &#8220;if I know anything at all, it is that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be best for others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean for one other?&#8221; Margaret asked, and
the girl bowed her head. &#8220;Ah, Babbie, you speak like
a child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not need to be told the circumstances to know
this&mdash;that if two people love each other, neither has
any right to give the other up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Babbie turned impulsively to cast herself on the
mercy of Gavin&#8217;s mother, but no word could she say; a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
hot tear fell from her eyes upon the coverlet, and then
she looked at the door, as if to run away.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have been too inquisitive,&#8221; Margaret began;
whereupon Babbie cried, &#8220;Oh no, no, no: you are very
good. I have no one who cares whether I do right or
wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your parents&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had none since I was a child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the more reason why I should be your friend,&#8221;
Margaret said, taking the girl&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not know what you are saying. You cannot
be my friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, I love you already. You have a good
face, Babbie, as well as a beautiful one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Babbie could remain in the room no longer. She
bade Margaret good-night and bent forward to kiss her;
then drew back, like a Judas ashamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you not kiss me?&#8221; Margaret asked in surprise,
but poor Babbie walked out of the room without
answering.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Of what occurred at the manse on the following day
until I reached it, I need tell little more. When Babbie
was tending Sam&#8217;l Farquharson&#8217;s child in the Tenements
she learned of the flood in Glen Quharity, and
that the greater part of the congregation had set off to
the assistance of the farmers; but fearful as this made
her for Gavin&#8217;s safety, she kept the new anxiety from
his mother. Deceived by another story of Jean&#8217;s, Margaret
was the one happy person in the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you had only a lover&#8217;s quarrel with Lord
Rintoul last night,&#8221; she said to Babbie in the afternoon.
&#8220;Ah, you see I can guess what is taking you to the
window so often. You must not think him long in
coming for you. I can assure you that the rain which
keeps my son from me must be sufficiently severe to
separate even true lovers. Take an old woman&#8217;s example,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
Babbie. If I thought the minister&#8217;s absence
alarming, I should be in anguish; but as it is, my mind
is so much at ease that, see, I can thread my needle.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was in less than an hour after Margaret spoke thus
tranquilly to Babbie that the precentor got into the
manse.</p>

<h2>Chapter Forty-Two.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />MARGARET, THE PRECENTOR, AND GOD BETWEEN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Unless Andrew Luke, who went to Canada, be still
above ground, I am now the only survivor of the few
to whom Lang Tammas told what passed in the manse
parlor after the door closed on him and Margaret.
With the years the others lost the details, but before
I forget them the man who has been struck by lightning
will look at his arm without remembering what shrivelled
it. There even came a time when the scene
seemed more vivid to me than to the precentor, though
that was only after he began to break up.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was never the kind o&#8217; woman,&#8221; Whamond said,
&#8220;that a body need be nane feared at. You can see she
is o&#8217; the timid sort. I couldna hae selected a woman
easier to speak bold out to, though I had ha&#8217;en my pick
o&#8217; them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was a gaunt man, sour and hard, and he often
paused in his story with a puzzled look on his forbidding
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, man, she was so michty windy o&#8217; him. If he
had wanted to put a knife into her, I believe that woman
would just hae telled him to take care no to cut his
hands. Ay, and what innocent-like she was! If she
had heard enough, afore I saw her, to make her uneasy,
I could hae begun at once; but here she was, shaking
my hand and smiling to me, so that aye when I tried to
speak I gaed through ither. Nobody can despise me
for it, I tell you, mair than I despise mysel&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thocht to mysel&#8217;, &#8216;Let her hae her smile out, Tammas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
Whamond; it&#8217;s her hinmost.&#8217; Syne wi&#8217; shame at
my cowardliness, I tried to yoke to my duty as chief
elder o&#8217; the kirk, and I said to her, as thrawn as I could
speak, &#8216;Dinna thank me; I&#8217;ve done nothing for you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I ken it wasna for me you did it,&#8217; she said, &#8216;but for
him; but, oh, Mr. Whamond, will that make me think
the less o&#8217; you? He&#8217;s my all,&#8217; she says, wi&#8217; that smile
back in her face, and a look mixed up wi&#8217;t that said as
plain, &#8216;and I need no more.&#8217; I thocht o&#8217; saying that
some builds their house upon the sand, but&mdash;dagont,
dominie, it&#8217;s a solemn thing the pride mithers has in
their laddies. I mind aince my ain mither&mdash;what the
devil are you glowering at, Andrew Luke? Do you
think I&#8217;m greeting?</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;ll sit down, Mr. Whamond,&#8217; she says next.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No, I winna,&#8217; I said, angry-like. &#8216;I didna come
here to sit.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could see she thocht I was shy at being in the
manse parlor; ay, and I thocht she was pleased at me
looking shy. Weel, she took my hat out o&#8217; my hand,
and she put it on the chair at the door, whaur there&#8217;s
aye an auld chair in grand houses for the servant to sit
on at family exercise.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;re a man, Mr. Whamond,&#8217; says she, &#8216;that the
minister delights to honor, and so you&#8217;ll oblige me by
sitting in his own armchair.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin never quite delighted to honor the precentor,
of whom he was always a little afraid, and perhaps
Margaret knew it. But you must not think less of her
for wanting to gratify her son&#8217;s chief elder. She
thought, too, that he had just done her a service. I
never yet knew a good woman who did not enjoy flattering
men she liked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw my chance at that,&#8221; Whamond went on, &#8220;and
I says to her sternly, &#8216;In worldly position,&#8217; I says, &#8216;I&#8217;m
a common man, and it&#8217;s no for the like o&#8217; sic to sit in a
minister&#8217;s chair; but it has been God&#8217;s will,&#8217; I says, &#8216;to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
wrap around me the mantle o&#8217; chief elder o&#8217; the kirk,
and if the minister falls awa frae grace, it becomes my
duty to take his place.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she had been looking at me, she maun hae grown
feared at that, and syne I could hae gone on though
my ilka word was a knockdown blow. But she was
picking some things aff the chair to let me down on&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s a pair o&#8217; mittens I&#8217;m working for the minister,&#8217;
she says, and she handed them to me. Ay, I tried
no to take them, but&mdash;Oh, lads, it&#8217;s queer to think
how saft I was.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He&#8217;s no to ken about them till they&#8217;re finished,&#8217;
she says, terrible fond-like.</p>
<p>&#8220;The words came to my mouth, &#8216;They&#8217;ll never be finished,&#8217;
and I could hae cursed mysel&#8217; for no saying
them. I dinna ken how it was, but there was something
pitiful in seeing her take up the mittens and begin
working cheerily at one, and me kenning all the
time that they would never be finished. I watched her
fingers, and I said to mysel&#8217;, &#8216;Another stitch, and that
maun be your last.&#8217; I said that to mysel&#8217; till I thocht
it was the needle that said it, and I wondered at her no
hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the tail o&#8217; the day I says, &#8216;You needna bother;
he&#8217;ll never wear them,&#8217; and they sounded sic words o&#8217;
doom that I rose up off the chair. Ay, but she took me
up wrang, and she said, &#8216;I see you have noticed how
careless o&#8217; his ain comforts he is, and that in his zeal
he forgets to put on his mittens, though they may be in
his pocket a&#8217; the time. Ay,&#8217; says she, confident-like,
&#8216;but he winna forget these mittens, Mr. Whamond, and
I&#8217;ll tell you the reason: it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re his mother&#8217;s
work.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I stamped my foot, and she gae me an apologetic
look, and she says, &#8216;I canna help boasting about his
being so fond o&#8217; me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but here was me saying to mysel&#8217;, &#8216;Do your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
duty, Tammas Whamond; you sluggard, do your duty,&#8217;
and without lifting my een frae her fingers I said
sternly, &#8216;The chances are,&#8217; I said, &#8216;that these mittens
will never be worn by the hands they are worked for.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You mean,&#8217; says she, &#8216;that he&#8217;ll gie them awa to
some ill-off body, as he gies near a&#8217; thing he has? Ay,
but there&#8217;s one thing he never parts wi&#8217;, and that&#8217;s my
work. There&#8217;s a young lady in the manse the now,&#8217;
says she, &#8216;that offered to finish the mittens for me, but
he would value them less if I let ony other body put a
stitch into them.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thocht to mysel&#8217;, &#8216;Tammas Whamond, the Lord
has opened a door to you, and you&#8217;ll be disgraced forever
if you dinna walk straucht in.&#8217; So I rose again,
and I says, boldly this time, &#8216;Whaur&#8217;s that young leddy?
I hae something to say to her that canna be kept waiting.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;She&#8217;s up the stair,&#8217; she says, surprised, &#8216;but you
canna ken her, Mr. Whamond, for she just came last
nicht.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I ken mair o&#8217; her than you think,&#8217; says I; &#8216;I ken
what brocht her here, and ken wha she thinks she is to
be married to, and I&#8217;ve come to tell her that she&#8217;ll
never get him.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;How no?&#8217; she said, amazed like.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Because,&#8217; said I, wi&#8217; my teeth thegither, &#8216;he is already
married.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lads, I stood waiting to see her fall, and when she
didna fall I just waited langer, thinking she was slow
in taking it a&#8217; in.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I see you ken wha she is,&#8217; she said, looking at me,
&#8216;and yet I canna credit your news.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;They&#8217;re true,&#8217; I cries.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Even if they are,&#8217; says she, considering, &#8216;it may be
the best thing that could happen to baith o&#8217; them.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sank back in the chair in fair bewilderment, for I
didna ken at that time, as we a&#8217; ken now, that she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
thinking o&#8217; the earl when I was thinking o&#8217; her son.
Dominie, it looked to me as if the Lord had opened a
door to me, and syne shut it in my face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Syne wi&#8217; me sitting there in a kind o&#8217; awe o&#8217; the
woman&#8217;s simpleness, she began to tell me what the
minister was like when he was a bairn, and I was saying
a&#8217; the time to mysel&#8217;, &#8216;You&#8217;re chief elder o&#8217; the
kirk, Tammas Whamond, and you maun speak out the
next time she stops to draw breath.&#8217; They were terrible
sma&#8217;, common things she telled me, sic as near a&#8217;
mithers minds about their bairns, but the kind o&#8217; holy
way she said them drove my words down my throat,
like as if I was some infidel man trying to break out
wi&#8217; blasphemy in a kirk.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ll let you see something,&#8217; says she, &#8216;that I ken
will interest you.&#8217; She brocht it out o&#8217; a drawer, and
what do you think it was? As sure as death it was no
more than some o&#8217; his hair when he was a litlin, and it
was tied up sic carefully in paper that you would hae
thocht it was some valuable thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mr. Whamond,&#8217; she says solemnly, &#8216;you&#8217;ve come
thrice to the manse to keep me frae being uneasy about
my son&#8217;s absence, and you was the chief instrument
under God in bringing him to Thrums, and I&#8217;ll gie you
a little o&#8217; that hair.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dagont, what did I care about his hair? and yet to
see her fondling it! I says to mysel&#8217;, &#8216;Mrs. Dishart,&#8217;
I says to mysel&#8217;, &#8216;I was the chief instrument under God
in bringing him to Thrums, and I&#8217;ve come here to tell
you that I&#8217;m to be the chief instrument under God in
driving him out o&#8217;t.&#8217; Ay, but when I focht to bring
out these words, my mouth snecked like a box.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Dinna gie me his hair,&#8217; was a&#8217; I could say, and I
wouldna take it frae her; but she laid it in my hand,
and&mdash;and syne what could I do? Ay, it&#8217;s easy to speak
about thae things now, and to wonder how I could hae
so disgraced the position o&#8217; chief elder o&#8217; the kirk, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
I tell you I was near greeting for the woman. Call me
names, dominie; I deserve them all.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did not call Whamond names for being reluctant to
break Margaret&#8217;s heart. Here is a confession I may
make. Sometimes I say my prayers at night in a
hurry, going on my knees indeed, but with as little
reverence as I take a drink of water before jumping into
bed, and for the same reason, because it is my nightly
habit. I am only pattering words I have by heart to
a chair then, and should be as well employed writing a
comic Bible. At such times I pray for the earthly
well-being of the precentor, though he has been dead
for many years. He crept into my prayers the day he
told me this story, and was part of them for so long
that when they are only a recitation he is part of them
still.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said to me,&#8221; Whamond continued, &#8220;that the
women o&#8217; the congregation would be fond to handle the
hair. Could I tell her that the women was waur agin
him than the men? I shivered to hear her.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Syne when they&#8217;re a&#8217; sitting breathless listening
to his preaching,&#8217; she says, &#8216;they&#8217;ll be able to picture
him as a bairn, just as I often do in the kirk mysel&#8217;.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Andrew Luke, you&#8217;re sneering at me, but I tell you
if you had been there and had begun to say, &#8216;He&#8217;ll
preach in our kirk no more,&#8217; I would hae struck you.
And I&#8217;m chief elder o&#8217; the kirk.</p>
<p>&#8220;She says, &#8216;Oh, Mr. Whamond, there&#8217;s times in the
kirk when he is praying, and the glow on his face is
hardly mortal, so that I fall a-shaking, wi&#8217; a mixture
o&#8217; fear and pride, me being his mother; and sinful
though I am to say it, I canna help thinking at sic
times that I ken what the mother o&#8217; Jesus had in her
heart when she found Him in the temple.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dominie, it&#8217;s sax-and-twenty years since I was made
an elder o&#8217; the kirk. I mind the day as if it was yestreen.
Mr. Carfrae made me walk hame wi&#8217; him, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
he took me into the manse parlor, and he set me in
that very chair. It was the first time I was ever in the
manse. Ay, he little thocht that day in his earnestness,
and I little thocht mysel&#8217; in the pride o&#8217; my lusty
youth, that the time was coming when I would swear
in that reverenced parlor. I say swear, dominie, for
when she had finished I jumped to my feet, and I cried,
&#8216;Hell!&#8217; and I lifted up my hat. And I was chief elder.</p>
<p>&#8220;She fell back frae my oath,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and syne she
took my sleeve and speired, &#8216;What has come ower you,
Mr. Whamond? Hae you onything on your mind?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ve sin on it,&#8217; I roared at her. &#8216;I have neglect o&#8217;
duty on it. I am one o&#8217; them that cries &#8220;Lord, Lord,&#8221;
and yet do not the things which He commands. He has
pointed out the way to me, and I hinna followed it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What is it you hinna done that you should hae
done?&#8217; she said. &#8216;Oh, Mr. Whamond, if you want my
help, it&#8217;s yours.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Your son&#8217;s a&#8217; the earth to you,&#8217; I cried, &#8216;but my
eldership&#8217;s as muckle to me. Sax-and-twenty years
hae I been an elder, and now I maun gie it up.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wha says that?&#8217; she speirs.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I say it,&#8217; I cried. &#8216;I&#8217;ve shirked my duty. I gie up
my eldership now. Tammas Whamond is no langer an
elder o&#8217; the kirk;&#8217; ay, and I was chief elder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dominie, I think she began to say that when the
minister came hame he wouldna accept my resignation,
but I paid no heed to her. You ken what was the
sound that keeped my ears frae her words; it was the
sound o&#8217; a machine coming yont the Tenements. You
ken what was the sicht that made me glare through the
window instead o&#8217; looking at her; it was the sicht o&#8217;
Mr. Dishart in the machine. I couldna speak, but I got
my body atween her and the window, for I heard shouting,
and I couldna doubt that it was the folk cursing
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she heard too, she heard too, and she squeezed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
by me to the window. I couldna look out; I just
walked saft-like to the parlor door, but afore I reached
it she cried joyously&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s my son come back, and see how fond o&#8217; him
they are! They are running at the side o&#8217; the machine,
and the laddies are tossing their bonnets in the air.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;God help you, woman!&#8217; I said to mysel&#8217;, &#8216;it canna
be bonnets&mdash;it&#8217;s stanes and divits mair likely that
they&#8217;re flinging at him.&#8217; Syne I creeped out o&#8217; the
manse. Dominie, you mind I passed you in the kitchen,
and didna say a word?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, I saw the precentor pass through the kitchen,
with such a face on him as no man ever saw him wear
again. Since Tammas Whamond died we have had to
enlarge the Thrums cemetery twice; so it can matter
not at all to him, and but little to me, what you who
read think of him. All his life children ran from him.
He was the dourest, the most unlovable man in Thrums.
But may my right hand wither, and may my tongue be
cancer-bitten, and may my mind be gone into a dry rot,
before I forget what he did for me and mine that day!</p>

<h2>Chapter Forty-Three.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />RAIN&mdash;MIST&mdash;THE JAWS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>To this day we argue in the glen about the sound
mistaken by many of us for the firing of the Spittal
cannon, some calling it thunder and others the tearing
of trees in the torrent. I think it must have been the
roll of stones into the Quharity from Silver Hill, of
which a corner has been missing since that day. Silver
Hill is all stones, as if creation had been riddled there,
and in the sun the mica on them shines like many pools
of water.</p>
<p>At the roar, as they thought, of the cannon, the farmers
looked up from their struggle with the flood to say,
&#8220;That&#8217;s Rintoul married,&#8221; as clocks pause simultaneously
to strike the hour. Then every one in the glen
save Gavin and myself was done with Rintoul. Before
the hills had answered the noise, Gavin was on his way
to the Spittal. The dog must have been ten minutes in
overtaking him, yet he maintained afterward that it
was with him from the start. From this we see that
the shock he had got carried him some distance before
he knew that he had left the school-house. It also
gave him a new strength, that happily lasted longer
than his daze of mind.</p>
<p>Gavin moved northward quicker than I came south,
climbing over or wading through his obstacles, while I
went round mine. After a time, too, the dog proved
useful, for on discovering that it was going homeward
it took the lead, and several times drew him to the
right road to the Spittal by refusing to accompany him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
on the wrong road. Yet in two hours he had walked
perhaps nine miles without being four miles nearer the
Spittal. In that flood the glen milestones were three
miles apart.</p>
<p>For some time he had been following the dog doubtfully,
for it seemed to be going too near the river.
When they struck a cart-track, however, he concluded
rightly that they were nearing a bridge. His faith in
his guide was again tested before they had been many
minutes on this sloppy road. The dog stopped, whined,
looked irresolute, and then ran to the right, disappearing
into the mist in an instant. He shouted to it to
come back, and was surprised to hear a whistle in reply.
This was sufficient to make him dash after the dog, and
in less than a minute he stopped abruptly by the side of
a shepherd.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you brocht it?&#8221; the man cried almost into
Gavin&#8217;s ear; yet the roar of the water was so tremendous
that the words came faintly, as if from a distance.
&#8220;Wae is me; is it only you, Mr. Dishart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it only you!&#8221; No one in the glen would have
addressed a minister thus except in a matter of life or
death, and Gavin knew it.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be ower late,&#8221; the shepherd exclaimed, rubbing
his hands together in distress. &#8220;I&#8217;m speaking o&#8217;
Whinbusses&#8217; grieve. He has run for ropes, but he&#8217;ll
be ower late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there some one in danger?&#8221; asked Gavin, who
stood, he knew not where, with this man, enveloped in
mist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there no? Look!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing to be seen but mist; where are we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re on the high bank o&#8217; the Quharity. Take
care, man; you was stepping ower into the roaring
water. Lie down and tell me if he&#8217;s there yet. Maybe
I just think that I see him, for the sicht is painted on
my een.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span></div>
<p>Gavin lay prone and peered at the river, but the mist
came up to his eyes. He only knew that the river was
below from the sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a man down there?&#8221; he asked, shuddering.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a minute syne; on a bit island.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why does he not speak?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is senseless. Dinna move; the mist&#8217;s clearing,
and you&#8217;ll see if he&#8217;s there syne. The mist has been
lifting and falling that way ilka minute since me and
the grieve saw him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mist did not rise. It only shook like a blanket,
and then again remained stationary. But in that
movement Gavin had seen twice, first incredulously,
and then with conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shepherd,&#8221; he said, rising, &#8220;it is Lord Rintoul.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, it&#8217;s him; and you saw his feet was in the water.
They were dry when the grieve left me. Mr. Dishart,
the ground he is on is being washed awa bit by bit.
I tell you, the flood&#8217;s greedy for him, and it&#8217;ll hae
him&mdash;&mdash;Look, did you see him again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he living?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw him move. Hst! Was that a cry?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was only the howling of the dog, which had
recognized its master and was peering over the bank,
the body quivering to jump, but the legs restless with
indecision.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we were down there,&#8221; Gavin said, &#8220;we could hold
him secure till rescue comes. It is no great jump.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How far would you make it? I saw him again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looked further that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it! Sometimes the ground he is on looks so
near that you think you could almost drop on it, and
the next time it&#8217;s yards and yards awa. I&#8217;ve stood
ready for the spring, Mr. Dishart, a dozen times, but
I aye sickened. I daurna do it. Look at the dog; just
when it&#8217;s starting to jump, it pulls itsel&#8217; back.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span></div>
<p>As if it had heard the shepherd, the dog jumped at
that instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sprang too far,&#8221; Gavin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It didna spring far enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>They waited, and presently the mist thinned for a
moment, as if it was being drawn out. They saw the
earl, but there was no dog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor brute,&#8221; said the shepherd, and looked with
awe at Gavin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rintoul is slipping into the water,&#8221; Gavin answered.
&#8220;You won&#8217;t jump?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m wae for him, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will,&#8221; Gavin was about to say, but the
shepherd continued, &#8220;And him only married twa hours
syne.&#8221;</p>
<p>That kept the words in Gavin&#8217;s mouth for half a
minute, and then he spoke them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinna think o&#8217;t,&#8221; cried the shepherd, taking him
by the coat. &#8220;The ground he is on is slippery. I&#8217;ve
flung a dozen stanes at it, and them that hit it slithered
off. Though you landed in the middle o&#8217;t, you would
slide into the water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He shook himsel&#8217; free o&#8217; me,&#8221; the shepherd told
afterward, &#8220;and I saw him bending down and measuring
the distance wi&#8217; his een as cool as if he was calculating
a drill o&#8217; tatties. Syne I saw his lips moving in
prayer. It wasna spunk he needed to pray for, though.
Next minute there was me, my very arms prigging wi&#8217;
him to think better o&#8217;t, and him standing ready to loup,
his knees bent, and not a tremble in them. The mist
lifted, and I&mdash;&mdash;Lads, I couldna gie a look to the earl.
Mr. Dishart jumped; I hardly saw him, but I kent,
I kent, for I was on the bank alane. What did I do? I
flung mysel&#8217; down in a sweat, and if een could bore
mist mine would hae done it. I thocht I heard the
minister&#8217;s death-cry, and may I be struck if I dinna believe
now that it was a skirl o&#8217; my ain. After that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
there was no sound but the jaw o&#8217; the water; and I
prayed, but no to God, to the mist to rise, and after an
awful time it rose, and I saw the minister was safe; he
had pulled the earl into the middle o&#8217; the bit island and
was rubbing him back to consciousness. I sweat when
I think o&#8217;t yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Little Minister&#8217;s jump is always spoken of as a
brave act in the glen, but at such times I am silent.
This is not because, being timid myself, I am without
admiration for courage. My little maid says that three
in every four of my poems are to the praise of prowess,
and she has not forgotten how I carried her on my
shoulder once to Tilliedrum to see a soldier who had
won the Victoria Cross, and made her shake hands with
him, though he was very drunk. Only last year one of
my scholars declared to me that Nelson never said
&#8220;England expects every man this day to do his duty,&#8221;
for which I thrashed the boy and sent him to the cooling-stone.
But was it brave of Gavin to jump? I have
heard some maintain that only misery made him so bold,
and others that he jumped because it seemed a fine
thing to risk his life for an enemy. But these are
really charges of cowardice, and my boy was never a
coward. Of the two kinds of courage, however, he did
not then show the nobler. I am glad that he was ready
for such an act, but he should have remembered Margaret
and Babbie. As it was, he may be said to have
forced them to jump with him. Not to attempt a gallant
deed for which one has the impulse, may be braver
than the doing of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though it seemed as lang time,&#8221; the shepherd says,
&#8220;as I could hae run up a hill in, I dinna suppose it was
many minutes afore I saw Rintoul opening and shutting
his een. The next glint I had o&#8217; them they were
speaking to ane another; ay, and mair than speaking.
They were quarrelling. I couldna hear their words,
but there was a moment when I thocht they were to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
grapple. Lads, the memory o&#8217; that&#8217;ll hing about my
deathbed. There was twa men, edicated to the highest
pitch, ane a lord and the other a minister, and the
flood was taking awa a mouthful o&#8217; their footing ilka
minute, and the jaws o&#8217; destruction was gaping for them,
and yet they were near fechting. We ken now it was
about a woman. Ay, but does that make it less awful?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, that did not make it less awful. It was even
awful that Gavin&#8217;s first words when Rintoul opened
his eyes and closed them hastily were, &#8220;Where is she?&#8221;
The earl did not answer; indeed, for the moment the
words had no meaning to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did I come here?&#8221; he asked feebly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should know better than I. Where is my wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember now,&#8221; Rintoul repeated several times.
&#8220;Yes, I had left the Spittal to look for you&mdash;you were
so long in coming. How did I find you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was I who found you,&#8221; Gavin answered. &#8220;You
must have been swept away by the flood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you too?&#8221;</p>
<p>In a few words Gavin told how he came to be beside
the earl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose they will say you have saved my life,&#8221;
was Rintoul&#8217;s commentary.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not saved yet. If help does not come, we shall
be dead men in an hour. What have you done with
my wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rintoul ceased to listen to him, and shouted sums of
money to the shepherd, who shook his head and bawled
an answer that neither Gavin nor the earl heard. Across
that thundering water only Gavin&#8217;s voice could carry,
the most powerful ever heard in a Thrums pulpit, the
one voice that could be heard all over the Commonty
during the time of the tent-preaching. Yet he never
roared, as some preachers do of whom we say, &#8220;Ah, if
they could hear the Little Minister&#8217;s word!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin caught the gesticulating earl by the sleeve,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
and said, &#8220;Another man has gone for ropes. Now,
listen to me; how dared you go through a marriage ceremony
with her, knowing her already to be my wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rintoul did listen this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know I married her?&#8221; he asked sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard the cannon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the earl understood, and the shadow on his face
shook and lifted, and his teeth gleamed. His triumph
might be short-lived, but he would enjoy it while he
could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he answered, picking the pebbles for his
sling with care, &#8220;you must know that I could not have
married her against her will. The frolic on the hill
amused her, but she feared you might think it serious,
and so pressed me to proceed with her marriage to-day
despite the flood.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the point at which the shepherd saw the
minister raise his fist. It fell, however, without striking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really think that I could doubt her?&#8221; Gavin
said compassionately, and for the second time in twenty-four
hours the earl learned that he did not know what
love is.</p>
<p>For a full minute they had forgotten where they were.
Now, again, the water seemed to break loose, so that
both remembered their danger simultaneously and
looked up. The mist parted for long enough to show
them that where had only been the shepherd was now
a crowd of men, with here and there a woman. Before
the mist again came between the minister had recognized
many members of his congregation.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>In his unsuccessful attempt to reach Whinbusses, the
grieve had met the relief party from Thrums. Already
the weavers had helped Waster Lunny to stave off ruin,
and they were now on their way to Whinbusses, keeping
together through fear of mist and water. Every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
few minutes Snecky Hobart rang his bell to bring in
stragglers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Follow me,&#8221; was all the panting grieve could say at
first, but his agitation told half his story. They went
with him patiently, only stopping once, and then excitedly,
for they come suddenly on Rob Dow. Rob was
still lying a prisoner beneath the tree, and the grieve
now remembered that he had fallen over this tree, and
neither noticed the man under it nor been noticed by
the man. Fifty hands released poor Dow, and two men
were commissioned to bring him along slowly while the
others hurried to the rescue of the earl. They were
amazed to learn from the shepherd that Mr. Dishart
also was in danger, and after &#8220;Is there a woman wi&#8217;
him?&#8221; some cried, &#8220;He&#8217;ll get off cheap wi&#8217; drowning,&#8221;
and &#8220;It&#8217;s the judgment o&#8217; God.&#8221;</p>
<p>The island on which the two men stood was now little
bigger than the round tables common in Thrums, and
its centre was some feet farther from the bank than
when Gavin jumped. A woman, looking down at it,
sickened, and would have toppled into the water, had
not John Spens clutched her. Others were so stricken
with awe that they forgot they had hands.</p>
<p>Peter Tosh, the elder, cast a rope many times, but
it would not carry. The one end was then weighted
with a heavy stone, and the other tied round the waists
of two men. But the force of the river had been underestimated.
The stone fell short into the torrent, which
rushed off with it so furiously that the men were flung
upon their faces and trailed to the verge of the precipice.
A score of persons sprang to their rescue, and
the rope snapped. There was only one other rope, and
its fate was not dissimilar. This time the stone fell
into the water beyond the island, and immediately
rushed down stream. Gavin seized the rope, but it
pressed against his body, and would have pushed him
off his feet had not Tosh cut it. The trunk of the tree
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
that had fallen on Rob Dow was next dragged to the
bank and an endeavor made to form a sloping bridge
of it. The island, however, was now soft and unstable,
and, though the trunk was successfully lowered, it only
knocked lumps off the island, and finally it had to be
let go, as the weavers could not pull it back. It
splashed into the water, and was at once whirled out
of sight. Some of the party on the bank began hastily
to improvise a rope of cravats and the tags of the ropes
still left, but the mass stood helpless and hopeless.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may wonder that we could have stood still,
waiting to see the last o&#8217; them,&#8221; Birse, the post, has said
to me in the school-house, &#8220;but, dominie, I couldna hae
moved, magre my neck. I&#8217;m a hale man, but if this
minute we was to hear the voice o&#8217; the Almighty saying
solemnly, &#8216;Afore the clock strikes again, Birse, the
post, will fall down dead of heart disease,&#8217; what do you
think you would do? I&#8217;ll tell you. You would stand
whaur you are, and stare, tongue-tied, at me till I
dropped. How do I ken? By the teaching o&#8217; that
nicht. Ay, but there&#8217;s a mair important thing I dinna
ken, and that is whether I would be palsied wi&#8217; fear like
the earl, or face death with the calmness o&#8217; the minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, the contrast between Rintoul and Gavin was
now impressive. When Tosh signed that the weavers
had done their all and failed, the two men looked in
each other&#8217;s faces, and Gavin&#8217;s face was firm and the
earl&#8217;s working convulsively. The people had given up
attempting to communicate with Gavin save by signs,
for though they heard his sonorous voice, when he
pitched it at them, they saw that he caught few words
of theirs. &#8220;He heard our skirls,&#8221; Birse said, &#8220;but
couldna grip the words ony mair than we could hear
the earl. And yet we screamed, and the minister
didna. I&#8217;ve heard o&#8217; Highlandmen wi&#8217; the same gift,
so that they could be heard across a glen.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We must prepare for death,&#8221; Gavin said solemnly
to the earl, &#8220;and it is for your own sake that I again ask
you to tell me the truth. Worldly matters are nothing
to either of us now, but I implore you not to carry a lie
into your Maker&#8217;s presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not give up hope,&#8221; was all Rintoul&#8217;s answer,
and he again tried to pierce the mist with offers of reward.
After that he became doggedly silent, fixing his
eyes on the ground at his feet. I have a notion that he
had made up his mind to confess the truth about Babbie
when the water had eaten the island as far as the point
at which he was now looking.</p>

</div>
<p>Out of the mist came the voice of Gavin, clear and
strong&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you hear me, hold up your hands as a sign.&#8221;</p>
<p>They heard, and none wondered at his voice crossing
the chasm while theirs could not. When the mist
cleared, they were seen to have done as he bade them.
Many hands remained up for a time because the people
did not remember to bring them down, so great was the
awe that had fallen on all, as if the Lord was near.</p>
<p>Gavin took his watch from his pocket, and he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am to fling this to you. You will give it to Mr.
Ogilvy, the schoolmaster, as a token of the love I bear
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The watch was caught by James Langlands, and
handed to Peter Tosh, the chief elder present.</p>
<p>&#8220;To Mr. Ogilvy,&#8221; Gavin continued, &#8220;you will also
give the chain. You will take it off my neck when you
find the body.</p>
<p>&#8220;To each of my elders, and to Hendry Munn, kirk
officer, and to my servant Jean, I leave a book, and
they will go to my study and choose it for themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;I also leave a book for Nanny Webster, and I charge
you, Peter Tosh, to take it to her, though she be not a
member of my church.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pictorial Bible with &#8216;To my son on his sixth
birthday&#8217; on it, I bequeath to Rob Dow. No, my
mother will want to keep that. I give to Rob Dow my
Bible with the brass clasp.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is my wish that every family in the congregation
should have some little thing to remember me by.
This you will tell my mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;To my successor I leave whatsoever of my papers
he may think of any value to him, including all my
notes on Revelation, of which I meant to make a book.
I hope he will never sing the paraphrases.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Mr. Carfrae&#8217;s health permits, you will ask him to
preach the funeral sermon; but if he be too frail, then
you will ask Mr. Trail, under whom I sat in Glasgow.
The illustrated &#8216;Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress&#8217; on the drawers in
my bedroom belongs to Mr. Trail, and you will return
it to him with my affection and compliments.</p>
<p>&#8220;I owe five shillings to Hendry Munn for mending
my boots, and a smaller sum to Baxter, the mason. I
have two pounds belonging to Rob Dow, who asked me
to take charge of them for him. I owe no other man
anything, and this you will bear in mind if Matthew
Cargill, the flying stationer, again brings forward a
claim for the price of Whiston&#8217;s &#8216;Josephus,&#8217; which I did
not buy from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Moncur, of Aberbrothick, had agreed to assist
me at the Sacrament, and will doubtless still lend his
services. Mr. Carfrae or Mr. Trail will take my place
if my successor is not elected by that time. The Sacrament
cups are in the vestry press, of which you will
find the key beneath the clock in my parlor. The
tokens are in the topmost drawer in my bedroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;The weekly prayer-meeting will be held as usual
on Thursday at eight o&#8217;clock, and the elders will officiate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my wish that the news of my death be broken
to my mother by Mr. Ogilvy, the schoolmaster, and by
no other. You will say to him that this is my solemn
request, and that I bid him discharge it without faltering
and be of good cheer.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if Mr. Ogilvy be not now alive, the news of my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
death will be broken to my mother by my beloved wife.
Last night I was married on the hill, over the tongs,
but with the sanction of God, to her whom you call the
Egyptian, and despite what has happened since then, of
which you will soon have knowledge, I here solemnly
declare that she is my wife, and you will seek for her
at the Spittal or elsewhere till you find her, and you
will tell her to go to my mother and remain with her
always, for these are the commands of her husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was then that Gavin paused, for Lord Rintoul had
that to say to him which no longer could be kept back.
All the women were crying sore, and also some men
whose eyes had been dry at the coffining of their children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I ken,&#8221; said Cruickshanks, who had been an
atheist, &#8220;that it&#8217;s only the fool wha&#8217; says in his heart,
&#8216;There is no God.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Another said, &#8220;That&#8217;s a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another said, &#8220;That man has a religion to last him
all through.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fourth said, &#8220;Behold, the Kingdom of Heaven is
at hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fifth said, &#8220;That&#8217;s our minister. He&#8217;s the minister
o&#8217; the Auld Licht Kirk o&#8217; Thrums. Woe is me, we&#8217;re
to lose him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many cried, &#8220;Our hearts was set hard against him.
O Lord, are you angry wi&#8217; your servants that you&#8217;re
taking him frae us just when we ken what he is?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gavin did not hear them, and again he spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;My brethren, God is good. I have just learned that
my wife is with my dear mother at the manse. I leave
them in your care and in His.&#8221;</p>
<p>No more he said of Babbie, for the island was become
very small.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord calls me hence. It is only for a little
time I have been with you, and now I am going away,
and you will know me no more. Too great has been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
my pride because I was your minister, but He who sent
me to labor among you is slow to wrath; and He ever
bore in mind that you were my first charge. My people,
I must say to you, &#8216;Farewell.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, for the first time, his voice faltered, and wanting
to go on he could not. &#8220;Let us read,&#8221; he said,
quickly, &#8220;in the Word of God in the fourteenth of
Matthew, from the twenty-eighth verse.&#8221;</p>
<p>He repeated these four verses:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And Peter answered Him and said, Lord, if it be
Thou, bid me come unto Thee on the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And He said, Come. And when Peter was come
down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to
Jesus.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was
afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord,
save me.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And immediately Jesus stretched forth His hand
and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little
faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>After this Gavin&#8217;s voice was again steady, and he
said, &#8220;The sand-glass is almost run out. Dearly beloved,
with what words shall I bid you good-by?&#8221;</p>
<p>Many thought that these were to be the words, for
the mist parted, and they saw the island tremble and
half of it sink.</p>
<p>&#8220;My people,&#8221; said the voice behind the mist, &#8220;this
is the text I leave with you: &#8216;Lay not up for yourselves
treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt,
and where thieves break through and steal; but lay up
for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth
nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break
through nor steal.&#8217; That text I read in the flood, where
the hand of God has written it. All the pound-notes in
the world would not dam this torrent for a moment, so
that we might pass over to you safely. Yet it is but a
trickle of water, soon to be dried up. Verily, I say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
unto you, only a few hours ago the treasures of earth
stood between you and this earl, and what are they now
compared to this trickle of water? God only can turn
rivers into a wilderness, and the water-springs into dry
ground. Let His Word be a lamp unto your feet and a
light unto your path; may He be your refuge and your
strength. Amen.&#8221;</p>
<p>This amen he said quickly, thinking death was now
come. He was seen to raise his hands, but whether to
Heaven or involuntarily to protect his face as he fell
none was sure, for the mist again filled the chasm.
Then came a clap of stillness. No one breathed.</p>
<p>But the two men were not yet gone, and Gavin spoke
once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us sing in the twenty-third Psalm.&#8221;</p>
<p>He himself raised the tune, and so long as they heard
his voice they sang&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;The Lord&#8217;s my shepherd, I&#8217;ll not want;</p>
<p class='indent2'>He makes me down to lie</p>
<p>In pastures green; He leadeth me</p>
<p class='indent2'>The quiet waters by.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;My soul He doth restore again;</p>
<p class='indent2'>And me to walk doth make</p>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Yea, though I walk in Death&#8217;s dark vale,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Yet will I fear none ill;</p>
<p>For Thou art with me; and Thy rod</p>
<p class='indent2'>And staff&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>But some had lost the power to sing in the first verse,
and others at &#8220;Death&#8217;s dark vale,&#8221; and when one man
found himself singing alone he stopped abruptly. This
was because they no longer heard the minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;O Lord!&#8221; Peter Tosh cried, &#8220;lift the mist, for it&#8217;s
mair than we can bear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mist rose slowly, and those who had courage to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
look saw Gavin praying with the earl. Many could not
look, and some of them did not even see Rob Dow jump.</p>
<p>For it was Dow, the man with the crushed leg, who
saved Gavin&#8217;s life, and flung away his own for it. Suddenly
he was seen on the edge of the bank, holding one
end of the improvised rope in his hand. As Tosh says&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It all happened in the opening and shutting o&#8217; an
eye. It&#8217;s a queer thing to say, but though I prayed to
God to take awa the mist, when He did raise it I couldna
look. I shut my een tight, and held my arm afore my
face, like ane feared o&#8217; being struck. Even when I
daured to look, my arm was shaking so that I could see
Rob both above it and below it. He was on the edge,
crouching to leap. I didna see wha had haud o&#8217; the
other end o&#8217; the rope. I heard the minister cry, &#8216;No,
Dow, no!&#8217; and it gae through me as quick as a stab that
if Rob jumped he would knock them both into the water.
But he did jump, and you ken how it was that he didna
knock them off.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was because he had no thought of saving his own
life. He jumped, not at the island, now little bigger
than the seat of a chair, but at the edge of it, into the
foam, and with his arm outstretched. For a second the
hand holding the rope was on the dot of land. Gavin
tried to seize the hand; Rintoul clutched the rope. The
earl and the minister were dragged together into safety,
and both left the water senseless. Gavin was never
again able to lift his left hand higher than his head.
Dow&#8217;s body was found next day near the school-house.</p>

<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />TALK OF A LITTLE MAID SINCE GROWN TALL.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>My scholars have a game they call &#8220;The Little Minister,&#8221;
in which the boys allow the girls as a treat to
join. Some of the characters in the real drama are
omitted as of no importance&mdash;the dominie, for instance&mdash;and
the two best fighters insist on being Dow and
Gavin. I notice that the game is finished when Dow
dives from a haystack, and Gavin and the earl are
dragged to the top of it by a rope. Though there should
be another scene, it is only a marriage, which the girls
have, therefore, to go through without the help of the
boys. This warns me that I have come to an end of
my story for all except my little maid. In the days
when she sat on my knee and listened it had no end,
for after I told her how her father and mother were
married a second time she would say, &#8220;And then I came,
didn&#8217;t I? Oh, tell me about me!&#8221; So it happened that
when she was no higher than my staff she knew more
than I could write in another book, and many a time
she solemnly told me what I had told her, as&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like me to tell you a story? Well, it&#8217;s
about a minister, and the people wanted to be bad to
him, and then there was a flood, and a flood is lochs
falling instead of rain, and so of course he was nearly
drownded, and he preached to them till they liked him
again, and so they let him marry her, and they like her
awful too, and, just think! it was my father; and that&#8217;s
all. Now tell me about grandmother when father came
home.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span></div>
<p>I told her once again that Margaret never knew how
nearly Gavin was driven from his kirk. For Margaret
was as one who goes to bed in the daytime and wakes
in it, and is not told that there has been a black night
while she slept. She had seen her son leave the manse
the idol of his people, and she saw them rejoicing as
they brought him back. Of what occurred at the Jaws,
as the spot where Dow had saved two lives is now called,
she learned, but not that these Jaws snatched him and
her from an ignominy more terrible than death, for
she never knew that the people had meditated driving
him from his kirk. This Thrums is bleak and perhaps
forbidding, but there is a moment of the day when a
setting sun dyes it pink, and the people are like their
town. Thrums was never colder in times of snow than
were his congregation to their minister when the Great
Rain began, but his fortitude rekindled their hearts.
He was an obstinate minister, and love had led him a
dance, but in the hour of trial he had proved himself a
man.</p>
<p>When Gavin reached the manse, and saw not only his
mother but Babbie, he would have kissed them both;
but Babbie could only say, &#8220;She does not know,&#8221; and
then run away crying. Gavin put his arm round his
mother, and drew her into the parlor, where he told
her who Babbie was. Now Margaret had begun to love
Babbie already, and had prayed to see Gavin happily
married; but it was a long time before she went upstairs
to look for his wife and kiss her and bring her down.
&#8220;Why was it a long time?&#8221; my little maid would ask,
and I had to tell her to wait until she was old, and had
a son, when she would find out for herself.</p>

&#8220;BABBIE COULD ONLY SAY, &#8216;SHE DOES NOT KNOW.&#8217;&#8221;<br />

<p>While Gavin and the earl were among the waters,
two men were on their way to Mr. Carfrae&#8217;s home, to
ask him to return with them and preach the Auld Licht
kirk of Thrums vacant; and he came, though now so
done that he had to be wheeled about in a little coach.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
He came in sorrow, yet resolved to perform what was
asked of him if it seemed God&#8217;s will; but, instead of
banishing Gavin, all he had to do was to remarry him
and kirk him, both of which things he did, sitting in
his coach, as many can tell. Lang Tammas spoke no
more against Gavin, but he would not go to the marriage,
and he insisted on resigning his eldership for a
year and a day. I think he only once again spoke to
Margaret. She was in the manse garden when he was
passing, and she asked him if he would tell her now
why he had been so agitated when he visited her on the
day of the flood. He answered gruffly, &#8220;It&#8217;s no business
o&#8217; yours.&#8221; Dr. McQueen was Gavin&#8217;s best man.
He died long ago of scarlet fever. So severe was the
epidemic that for a week he was never in bed. He attended
fifty cases without suffering, but as soon as he
had bent over Hendry Munn&#8217;s youngest boys, who both
had it, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m smitted,&#8221; and went home to die.
You may be sure that Gavin proved a good friend to
Micah Dow. I have the piece of slate on which Rob
proved himself a good friend to Gavin; it was in his
pocket when we found the body. Lord Rintoul returned
to his English estates, and never revisited the Spittal.
The last thing I heard of him was that he had been
offered the Lord-Lieutenantship of a county, and had
accepted it in a long letter, in which he began by pointing
out his unworthiness. This undid him, for the
Queen, or her councillors, thinking from his first page
that he had declined the honor, read no further, and
appointed another man. Waster Lunny is still alive,
but has gone to another farm. Sanders Webster, in his
gratitude, wanted Nanny to become an Auld Licht, but
she refused, saying, &#8220;Mr. Dishart is worth a dozen o&#8217;
Mr. Duthie, and I&#8217;m terrible fond o&#8217; Mrs. Dishart, but
Established I was born and Established I&#8217;ll remain
till I&#8217;m carried out o&#8217; this house feet foremost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Nanny went to Heaven for all that,&#8221; my little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
maid told me. &#8220;Jean says people can go to Heaven
though they are not Auld Lichts, but she says it takes
them all their time. Would you like me to tell you a
story about my mother putting glass on the manse dike?
Well, my mother and my father is very fond of each
other, and once they was in the garden, and my father
kissed my mother, and there was a woman watching
them over the dike, and she cried out&mdash;something
naughty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Tibbie Birse,&#8221; I said, &#8220;and what she cried
was, &#8216;Mercy on us, that&#8217;s the third time in half an hour!&#8217;
So your mother, who heard her, was annoyed, and put
glass on the wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s me that is telling you the story. You are
sure you don&#8217;t know it? Well, they asked father to take
the glass away, and he wouldn&#8217;t; but he once preached
at mother for having a white feather in her bonnet, and
another time he preached at her for being too fond of
him. Jean told me. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one seeing Babbie going to church demurely on
Gavin&#8217;s arm could guess her history. Sometimes I
wonder whether the desire to be a gypsy again ever
comes over her for a mad hour, and whether, if so,
Gavin takes such measures to cure her as he threatened
in Caddam Wood. I suppose not; but here is another
story:</p>

<p class='caption'>
&#8220;THERE WAS A WOMAN WATCHING THEM OVER THE DIKE.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;When I ask mother to tell me about her once being
a gypsy she says I am a bad &#8217;quisitive little girl, and
to put on my hat and come with her to the prayer-meeting;
and when I asked father to let me see
mother&#8217;s gypsy frock he made me learn Psalm forty-eight
by heart. But once I see&#8217;d it, and it was a long
time ago, as long as a week ago. Micah Dow gave me
rowans to put in my hair, and I like Micah because he
calls me Miss, and so I woke in my bed because there
was noises, and I ran down to the parlor, and there was
my mother in her gypsy frock, and my rowans was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
her hair, and my father was kissing her, and when they
saw me they jumped; and that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like me to tell you another story? It is
about a little girl. Well, there was once a minister
and his wife, and they hadn&#8217;t no little girls, but just
little boys, and God was sorry for them, so He put a
little girl in a cabbage in the garden, and when they
found her they were glad. Would you like me to tell
you who the little girl was? Well, it was me, and,
ugh! I was awful cold in the cabbage. Do you like
that story?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I like it best of all the stories I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I like it, too. Couldn&#8217;t nobody help loving
me, &#8217;cause I&#8217;m so nice? Why am I so fearful nice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you are like your grandmother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was clever of my father to know when he found
me in the cabbage that my name was Margaret. Are
you sorry grandmother is dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad your mother and father were so good to
her and made her so happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you happy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But when I am happy I laugh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am old, you see, and you are young.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am nearly six. Did you love grandmother? Then
why did you never come to see her? Did grandmother
know you was here? Why not? Why didn&#8217;t I not
know about you till after grandmother died?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you when you are big.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I be big enough when I am six?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not till your eighteenth birthday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But birthdays comes so slow. Will they come
quicker when I am big?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much quicker.&#8221;</p>
<p>On her sixth birthday Micah Dow drove my little
maid to the school-house in the doctor&#8217;s gig, and she
crept beneath the table and whispered&mdash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Grandfather!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father told me to call you that if I liked, and I
like,&#8221; she said when I had taken her upon my knee.
&#8220;I know why you kissed me just now. It was because
I looked like grandmother. Why do you kiss me when
I look like her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you I did that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody didn&#8217;t tell me. I just found out. I loved
grandmother too. She told me all the stories she
knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she ever tell you a story about a black dog?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Did she know one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she knew it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps she had forgotten it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she remembered it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not till you are eighteen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But will you not be dead when I am eighteen?
When you go to Heaven, will you see grandmother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will she be glad to see you?&#8221;</p>
<p>My little maid&#8217;s eighteenth birthday has come, and
I am still in Thrums, which I love, though it is beautiful
to none, perhaps, save to the very done, who lean
on their staves and look long at it, having nothing else
to do till they die. I have lived to rejoice in the happiness
of Gavin and Babbie; and if at times I have suddenly
had to turn away my head after looking upon
them in their home surrounded by their children, it was
but a moment&#8217;s envy that I could not help. Margaret
never knew of the dominie in the glen. They wanted
to tell her of me, but I would not have it. She has
been long gone from this world; but sweet memories
of her still grow, like honeysuckle, up the white walls
of the manse, smiling in at the parlor window and beckoning
from the door, and for some filling all the air
with fragrance. It was not she who raised the barrier
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
between her and me, but God Himself; and to those
who maintain otherwise, I say they do not understand
the purity of a woman&#8217;s soul. During the years she
was lost to me her face ever came between me and ungenerous
thoughts; and now I can say, all that is carnal
in me is my own, and all that is good I got from her.
Only one bitterness remains. When I found Gavin in
the rain, when I was fighting my way through the flood,
when I saw how the hearts of the people were turned
against him&mdash;above all, when I found Whamond in the
manse&mdash;I cried to God, making promises to Him, if He
would spare the lad for Margaret&#8217;s sake, and he spared
him; but these promises I have not kept.</p>
